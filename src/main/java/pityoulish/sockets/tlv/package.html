Utility classes for implementing the binary TLV protocol.

The protocol defines messages with TLV structures according to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Encoding_Rules"
 >Basic Encoding Rules (BER)</a>.
The interface {@link pityoulish.sockets.tlv.TLV TLV}
represents a TLV structure in memory, stored in a byte array.
There are two derived interfaces,
{@link pityoulish.sockets.tlv.BuildTLV} to construct new TLVs and
{@link pityoulish.sockets.tlv.ParseTLV} for parsing received TLVs.
Have a look at <a href="HowToBuildTLV.java.txt">HowToBuildTLV.java</a>
and <a href="HowToParseTLV.java.txt">HowToParseTLV.java</a>,
respectively, to learn how to use them.

All TLV types (aka <i>tags</i>) used in the binary protocol are defined
in the {@link pityoulish.sockets.tlv.MsgBoardType MsgBoardType} enum.
The {@link pityoulish.sockets.tlv.MsgBoardTLV} class
implements the interfaces mentioned above, with the specific restrictions
imposed by the binary protocol. Actually, those restrictions are designed
to simplify the TLV implementation.
