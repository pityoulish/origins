Exercise: Message Board Client with Sockets.

<p>
When called from the command line
through the {@link pityoulish.sockets.client.Main} class,
the client sends one request to the server,
receives and processes the response, then ends.
Two command-line arguments specify the server to contact,
this information is passed to the
{@link pityoulish.sockets.client.SocketBackendHandler}.
Further command-line arguments specify the request to be sent,
this information is passed to the
{@link pityoulish.sockets.client.MsgBoardCommandDispatcher},
which delegates to a
{@link pityoulish.sockets.client.MsgBoardClientHandler}.
That's where the real action takes place.
</p>

<p>
Implementations of the client handler interface should be derived from
{@link pityoulish.sockets.client.MsgBoardClientHandlerBase}.
This base class calls a {@link pityoulish.sockets.client.RequestBuilder}
to turn command-line arguments into a request.
The implementation then sends that request to the server and receives
the response.
{@link pityoulish.sockets.client.MsgBoardClientHandlerImpl}
uses traditional, blocking IO for communication.
After receiving the response, the implementation feeds it to a
{@link pityoulish.sockets.client.ResponseParser}, which calls a
{@link pityoulish.sockets.client.ResponseParser.Visitor}
to process the received data.
</p>

<p>
{@link pityoulish.sockets.client.TLVRequestBuilderImpl} and
{@link pityoulish.sockets.client.TLVResponseParserImpl}
build and parse the TLV structures specified by the Binary Protocol.
The {@link pityoulish.sockets.client.FormattingVisitorImpl}
prints response data to the console.
{@link pityoulish.sockets.client.SocketBackendHandlerImpl}
opens the connection to the server. Sending and receiving data
is left to the client handler implementation, as mentioned above.
</p>

<p>
The {@link pityoulish.sockets.client.Main} class instantiates
the various handlers and helpers to execute a single request.
When you implement a different client, for example one that
runs permanently and executes requests periodically,
you can re-use some of those classes.
However, you can also substitute different implementations.
For example, a different visitor to process response data.
Or a different client handler that uses asynchronous NIO and
connects to multiple Message Board servers at the same time.
