Exercise: Message Board Client with Sockets.

<p>
When called from the command line
through the {@link pityoulish.sockets.client.Main} class,
the client sends one request to the server,
receives and processes the response, then ends.
Utility classes from package {@link pityoulish.mbclient}
are used for evaluating the command-line arguments.
They eventually call a sockets-based implementation of
{@link pityoulish.mbclient.MsgBoardClientHandler} here.
The {@link pityoulish.sockets.client.Main} class instantiates
the various handlers and helpers described below.
</p>

<h2>Protocol Layers</h2>
<p>
In this client, the message board protocol materializes
on different layers of abstraction:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Application Layer - operations, arguments, results</li>
<li>Message Layer - TLV structures</li>
<li>Transport Layer - connections, byte buffers</li>
</ol>

<h3>Application Layer</h3>
<p>
On the sending side,
class {@link pityoulish.sockets.client.MsgBoardClientHandlerBase}
provides one method for each operation supported by the protocol.
Arguments like username, ticket or a limit
are passed in as Java strings or numbers.
On the receiving side,
interface {@link pityoulish.sockets.client.ResponseParser.Visitor}
has methods for the different response types.
The information in the results is also represented with Java types,
in this case strings and booleans. The implementation
class {@link pityoulish.sockets.client.FormattingVisitorImpl}
simply prints the response data to the console. 
</p>

<h3>Transport Layer</h3>
<p>
The transport layer sends and receives byte buffers over socket connections.
Class {@link pityoulish.sockets.client.MsgBoardClientHandlerImpl}
has one method for sending a request and one for receiving a response.
The required socket is created and connected in
class {@link pityoulish.sockets.client.SocketBackendHandlerImpl}.
The backend handler allows for blocking or non-blocking IO on the socket.
The client handler implementation uses traditional, blocking IO.
</p>
<p>
The transport layer needs some minimal knowledge about the message format,
to decide when the incoming data contains a complete message.
For this purpose, it interprets the length of the top-level TLV,
without looking at the value.
</p>


<h3>Message Layer</h3>
<p>
The message layer translates between the application layer
and the transport layer.
On the sending side,
class {@link pityoulish.sockets.client.TLVRequestBuilderImpl}
provides one method for each operation. It expects the arguments as
Java data types, as provided by the application layer,
and returns the fully encoded TLV request as a byte buffer.
On the receiving side,
class {@link pityoulish.sockets.client.TLVResponseParserImpl}
is given a byte buffer to parse and an application-layer visitor
to call with the parsed information.
</p>


<h3>Stacking the Layers</h3>
<p>
The base class {@link pityoulish.sockets.client.MsgBoardClientHandlerBase}
implements the sending side of the application layer.
It gets initialized with two message-layer helpers,
a request builder and a response parser. Of these,
it uses the request builder to generate a transport layer byte buffer,
which it passes to the abstract <code>fireRequest</code> method.
<br>
The derived implementation class
{@link pityoulish.sockets.client.MsgBoardClientHandlerImpl}
implements the transport layer for the sending and receiving side,
called through <code>fireRequest</code>.
The class gets initialized with a third helper,
an application-layer response visitor.
When a response has been received, the client handler implementation uses
the response parser kept in the base class with its own response visitor
to get back to the application layer.
</p>



<h2>Roll Your Own</h2>

<p>
When you implement a different client program, for example one that
runs permanently and executes requests periodically,
you can re-use some of these classes.
However, you can also substitute different implementations.
For example, a different visitor to process response data.
Or a different client handler that uses asynchronous NIO and
connects to multiple Message Board servers at the same time.
</p>


<h3>Replacing the Message Layer</h3>

<p>
If the message format should be changed, for example from TLV to JSON,
the application layer classes could be re-used without changes.
On the message layer, new helpers for building and parsing JSON
instead of TLV are needed.
And the transport layer requires some changes on the receiving side,
to detect when a JSON message rather than a TLV message is complete.
<br>
The separation of the protocol layers could be improved by refactoring.
The logic to determine when an incoming message is complete could be
moved into the response parser helper, with some effort
(<a href="https://github.com/rolandweber/pityoulish/issues/13">issue #13</a>).
Then the message layer could be replaced without changing the application
or transport layer at all.
The reason for not implementing it this way in the first place
is a design principle called
