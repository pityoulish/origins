Message Board Server with sockets:
server-side implementation of the binary protocol for the Message Board.

<p>
This package distinguishes three layers for handling requests:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
Application Layer, see
{@link pityoulish.sockets.server.MsgBoardRequestHandler}
</dt>
<dd>
Request data is available as Java objects,
encapsulated by {@link pityoulish.sockets.server.MsgBoardRequest}.
Response data is provided as Java objects,
the classes depend on the request.
This layer executes the requested operations.
It is unaware of the wire format for requests or responses.
</dd>
<dt>Protocol Layer, see
{@link pityoulish.sockets.server.RequestHandler}
</dt>
<dd>
Request data is available as binary data in memory.
Response data is provided as binary data in memory.
This layer takes care of parsing and building the wire format,
using {@link pityoulish.sockets.server.RequestParser}
and   {@link pityoulish.sockets.server.ResponseBuilder} helpers.
It is unaware of the communication technology and threading details.
</dd>
<dt>Transport Layer, see
{@link pityoulish.sockets.server.SocketHandler}
</dt>
<dd>
Request data is received from clients into memory.
Response data is sent to clients from memory.
This layer takes care of accepting connections, reading, and writing.
The implementation determines how many threads are used for servicing,
how many requests can be processed in parallel, and the like.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The {@link pityoulish.sockets.server.Main} class interprets
command-line arguments, then creates the stack of handlers and helpers.
</p>

<p>
On the application layer,
{@link pityoulish.sockets.server.MsgBoardRequestImpl}
contains request data and
{@link pityoulish.sockets.server.MsgBoardRequestHandlerImpl}
executes requested operations.
</p>

<p>
On the protocol layer,
{@link pityoulish.sockets.server.RequestHandlerImpl}
parses requests, calls the application-layer handler, and builds responses.
The TLV wire format is implemented
in  {@link pityoulish.sockets.server.TLVRequestParserImpl}
and {@link pityoulish.sockets.server.TLVResponseBuilderImpl}.
</p>

<p>
On the transport layer,
{@link pityoulish.sockets.server.SimplisticSocketHandler}
implements the bare minimum of functionality. It uses a single thread to
accept connections, read requests, handle requests, and send responses.
Because it uses blocking IO, it cannot accept a new connection while
serving a request.
Malicious clients could send requests slowly, byte by byte,
to make the server unavailable for other clients.
<i>
An implementation with asynchronous IO is planned for the future, see
<a href="https://github.com/pityoulish/origins/issues/15">Issue #15</a>.
