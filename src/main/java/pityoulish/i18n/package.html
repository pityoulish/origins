<p>
As explained in a <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n"
    >W3 FAQ</a>,
internationalization (i18n) is the task of preparing a program for
localization (l10n). The latter includes translation into different languages.
Other terms commonly used in this context are globalization (g11n)
and national language support (NLS).
</p>

<p>
The Pityoulish programming exercises employ only a
<a href="#limitations">limited</a> form of i18n.
This package provides interfaces and helpers for that.

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>
To facilitate translation, text should not be hard-coded. Instead, each
software component defines a <i>catalog</i> of user messages and text literals.
The actual strings for the catalog entries are defined in properties files.
The code uses the catalog to look up the strings.
A catalog might look like this:
</p>
<pre>
public enum MyCatalog implements TextEntry {
  FIRST_MESSAGE_3, SECOND_MESSAGE_0, LITERAL_A, LITERAL_B;
  ... // see pityoulish.tutorial.Catalog for method implementations
}
</pre>
<p>
The catalog is accompanied by a properties file with the default content,
typically in American English.
The default content can be translated into other languages and locales.
The translations are stored in additional properties files, one for
each translation. See the JavaDocs of <code>java.util.ResourceBundle</code>
for naming conventions and search order.
The default content for the catalog above might be:
</p>
<pre>
FIRST_MESSAGE_3  = Key "{1}" has value "{2}" in table "{0}".
SECOND_MESSAGE_0 = A message doesn''t need to have parameters.
LITERAL_A        = Literal text has no parameters, it doesn't get formatted.
LITERAL_B        = Therefore, different escaping rules apply.
</pre>
<p>
By convention, catalog entries with a numeric suffix are messages for
formatting with <code>java.text.MessageFormat</code>.
See there for the full syntax and escaping rules.
Most notably, <code>{<i>n</i>}</code> formats the <i>n</i>-th parameter, and
the single quote is an escape character which must be escaped itself
to appear in the formatted output.
The suffix indicates how many parameters the catalog entry formats.
Catalog entries without a numeric suffix are for literal texts rather than
format strings. For example, these could be labels for a UI or column headings
for tabular output.
Interface {@link pityoulish.i18n.TextEntry TextEntry} defines
different methods for formatting messages and for looking up literals:
</p>
<pre>
String fm = MyCatalog.FIRST_MESSAGE_3.format("TableABC", "KeyXYZ", "MyValue");
String sm = MyCatalog.SECOND_MESSAGE_0.format();
String la = MyCatalog.LITERAL_A.lookup();
String lb = MyCatalog.LITERAL_B.lookup();
</pre>
<p>
The {@link pityoulish.i18n.CatalogHelper CatalogHelper} provides static
utility methods for implementing catalogs. They take care of looking up and
formatting strings, and of evaluating the numeric suffix. See the source code
of class <code>pityoulish.tutorial.Catalog</code> for their usage.

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>
I18n support in the programming exercises covers only the translation of
strings and message formats. Message formats support some further localization,
like date and time formatting.
However, the programming exercises make one significant <b>assumption</b>:
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: larger; text-align: center;">
All lookups can be done with the default locale of the JVM.
</p>
<p>
More often than not, this assumption is <b>wrong</b> in real-life projects.
You might get away with it in a standalone program.
But in a client-server environment, this approach falls short.
A web browser sends the user's preferred locale to the server.
When the server generates output, it is expected to use the locale
requested by the client. And worse:
An error message might have to be sent to the client in the requested locale,
but also written to a log file in the server locale.
There cannot be a single lookup at the place where the message originates.
The originator has to return a lookup key,
like {@link pityoulish.i18n.TextEntry},
and the parameters to be formatted with it.
The lookup of locale-specific strings is deferred until the message
is sent to the client, or written to the server log.
That way, each formatting of the message can use a different locale.
</p>

<p>
Even if you are implementing a standalone program, you might
work with libraries that are also used for a server,
and therefore return lookup keys instead of formatted messages.
On the plus side, when doing it right, you don't have to pass the
client locale to every part of the server that might generate a message.
