Ticket management on the server.

<p>
A {@link pityoulish.tickets.Ticket} always resides on the server.
Only the {@link pityoulish.tickets.Ticket#getToken token},
a string identifier for the ticket, is passed to a client.
The {@link pityoulish.tickets.TicketManager}
keeps track of issued tickets and maps tokens to tickets.
Authorized operations are counted down by the tickets themselves.
