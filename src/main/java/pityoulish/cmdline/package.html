Utility classes for implementing command-line tools.

<p>
There's a bunch of classes to interpret command-line arguments.
The logic expects a command word at a certain, configurable position.
It selects a {@link pityoulish.cmdline.CommandHandler} which supports
the command word and calls its <code>handle</code> method.
Arguments after the command word are passed to that method.
Command handlers that support several command words can dispatch to
command-specific handler methods.
A certain, configurable number of arguments before the command word is passed
to a {@link pityoulish.cmdline.BackendHandler}. This is typically used to
specify hostname and port of a server, if that is needed by all the commands.
