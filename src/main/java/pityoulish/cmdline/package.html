Utility classes for interpreting command-line arguments.

<p>
An {@link pityoulish.cmdline.ArgsInterpreter}
knows one {@link pityoulish.cmdline.BackendHandler}
and a list of {@link pityoulish.cmdline.CommandHandler}s.
The backend handler expects a fixed number of arguments, typically two:
hostname and port of a server.
Backend arguments are the same for all commands.
The next argument is a command word, also mandatory.
All further arguments are command-specific.
<br/>
The logic in {@link pityoulish.cmdline.ArgsInterpreter}
provides the required number of arguments to the
{@link pityoulish.cmdline.BackendHandler}.
Then it looks for a {@link pityoulish.cmdline.CommandHandler}
that supports the command word with the remaining arguments.
A command handler can support several command words with a varying number
of arguments. The {@link pityoulish.cmdline.CommandHandlerBase} helps
with implementing command detection and dispatch.
