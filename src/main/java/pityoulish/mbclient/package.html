Message Board Client utilities.

<p>
Some aspects of the Message Board clients do not depend on the transport
used between client and server. For example, the server is identified by
a hostname and a port number. Also, the list of commands supported by the
clients is identical across exercises.
This package is for code that implements these common aspects.
