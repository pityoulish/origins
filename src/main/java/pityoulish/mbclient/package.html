Message Board Client utilities.

<p>
Some aspects of the Message Board clients do not depend on the transport
used between client and server.
This package is for code that implements these common aspects.
For example, the server is identified by a hostname and a port number.
</p>

<p>
Command-line clients support the operations listed in
{@link pityoulish.mbclient.MsgBoardCommandDispatcher.MsgBoardCommand MsgBoardCommand}.
The first two command-line arguments specify the server to contact,
this information is passed to the
{@link pityoulish.mbclient.HostPortBackendHandler}.
Further command-line arguments specify the operation and its parameters.
This information is evaluated by the
{@link pityoulish.mbclient.MsgBoardCommandDispatcher},
which delegates to a
{@link pityoulish.mbclient.MsgBoardClientHandler}.
That's where the real action takes place.
Different clients will implement that interface differently.
