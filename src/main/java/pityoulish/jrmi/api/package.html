Remote API for the Message Board and related features.

<p>
This package comprises remote interfaces, data object interfaces,
and serializable data object implementations.
Although the data objects have a striking similarity with those of
the internal server API, they are not the same.
To ease the distinction, different interface and class names have been chosen.
Objects of the internal server API cannot be serialized and sent to a client,
because the client is missing the classes to deserialize them.
If the client had those classes, it wouldn't be an internal server API anymore.
