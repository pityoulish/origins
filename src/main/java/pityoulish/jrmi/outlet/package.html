Exercise: Direct Message Outlet with Java RMI.

<p>
The program is invoked from the command line through
the {@link pityoulish.jrmi.outlet.Main} class.

Two command-line arguments specify the server to contact,
this information is passed to the
{@link pityoulish.jrmi.outlet.RegistryBackendHandler}.
Further command-line arguments specify the operation to perform,
this information is passed to the
{@link pityoulish.jrmi.outlet.MsgOutletCommandDispatcher},
which delegates to a
{@link pityoulish.jrmi.outlet.MsgOutletHandler}.
That's where the real action takes place.
</p>

<p>
For the operation "open", the handler instantiates a
{@link pityoulish.jrmi.outlet.DirectMessageOutletImpl},
publishes that on the server, and waits for a given timespan.
During this time, other JVMs can remotely call the outlet
to deliver messages, which will be printed to standard output.
When the timespan is over, the handler attempts to unpublish
and close the outlet.
Quite often, this will fail because the ticket has expired or
does not allow any more actions. That's an intentional flaw,
designed to confront students with error situations.
</p>

<p>
For other operations, the handler performs a series of remote calls
as required. It reports progress and results to standard output,
then terminates without further delay.
