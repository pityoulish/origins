#                   === Notes for Translators ===
#
# The format of the entries is
# <key> = [msgcode:] <value> \
#    <value continued>
#
# Translate only the values, not the keys and not the message codes.
# If the key ends with _<number>, its value is used for message formatting.
# See JavaDocs of java.text.MessageFormat for the escaping rules.
# If the key does not end with _<number>, the value is not for formatting.
# Some escape processing is performed for properties files in general.
# See JavaDocs of java.util.Properties, method 'load' for escaping rules.
#
# Use \n as the line separator in multi-line texts.
