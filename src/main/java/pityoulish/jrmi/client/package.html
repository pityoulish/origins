Exercise: Message Board Client with Java RMI.

<p>
When called from the command line
through the {@link pityoulish.jrmi.client.Main} class,
the client looks up the RMI registry, then the relevant anchor object,
performs one remote call to the server, reports the result,
and finally ends.
Utility classes from package {@link pityoulish.mbclient}
are used for evaluating the command-line arguments.
They eventually call an RMI-based implementation of
{@link pityoulish.mbclient.MsgBoardClientHandler} here.
</p>

<p>
The implementation of the client handler interface is
{@link pityoulish.jrmi.client.MsgBoardClientHandlerImpl}.
With the given remote API, and the single-call functionality explained above,
there's not much point in an alternative implementation.
