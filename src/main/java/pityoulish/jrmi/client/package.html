Exercise: Message Board Client with Java RMI.

<p>
When called from the command line
through the {@link pityoulish.jrmi.client.Main} class,
the client looks up the RMI registry, then the relevant anchor object,
performs one remote call to the server, reports the result,
and finally ends.
Two command-line arguments specify the server to contact,
this information is passed to the
{@link pityoulish.jrmi.client.RegistryBackendHandler}.
Further command-line arguments specify the call to perform,
this information is passed to the
{@link pityoulish.sockets.client.MsgBoardCommandDispatcher},
which delegates to a
{@link pityoulish.sockets.client.MsgBoardClientHandler}.
That's where the real action takes place.
</p>

<p>
The implementation of the client handler interface is
{@link pityoulish.sockets.client.MsgBoardClientHandlerImpl}.
With the given remote API, and the single-call functionality explained above,
there's not much point in an alternative implementation.
