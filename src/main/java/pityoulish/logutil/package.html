Utility classes for Logging.

<p>
Pityoulish uses <code>java.util.logging</code> (JUL).
That API is very useful, although it has some limitations in its handling
of resource bundles from different class loaders.
The classes here in this package provide some convenience methods,
for example to create loggers and to set the logging configuration.
