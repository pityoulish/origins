Indicator of missing code.

<p>
For some of the programming exercises, the code is preprocessed
to remove certain pieces that the students have to replace.
Instead of the missing pieces, they'll just find calls that throw
{@link pityoulish.outtake.Missing}.
The stack traces help to locate where code is missing.
