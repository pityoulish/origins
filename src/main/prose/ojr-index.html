  <span>Exercise: Direct Messages with Java RMI</span>
</h1>
<p class="abstract">
During this exercise, you will have a close encounter with the intricacies
of the callee side of remote method invocations.
</p>

<div class="larger">
<p>
Your task is to <a href="test-fix-repeat.html">Test and Fix</a>
a Java program that sends and receives
<a href="direct-messages.html"
   title="high-level description of Direct Message functionality"
   >Direct Messages</a>.
This exposes the callee side of remote invocations.
</p>

<p>
A recipe for solving this task has been conveyed beforehand in a Tutorial.
It was applied in a previous exercise about the Message Board with Java RMI.
If you missed both, you're probably screwed now.
Unless you have experience with programming and debugging.

<p>
You already set up a Java development environment in the Tutorial.
Editor, Java compiler and tools, maybe an IDE, are readily available.
Good.
</p>

<p>
You already know how to access the instructions for this exercise,
because you're reading them. Good.
Other useful things you could open in separate browser tabs are
the Java Platform API specification (aka standard JavaDocs)
and the <a href="test-fix-repeat.html">Test and Fix</a> reminder.
Where to find the standard JavaDocs depends on the network setup.
</p>

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

  <span>Network</span>

</h3>

<p>
Connect your computer to the network with the server, if you have not
done so already. The instructor provides all necessary information,
along with the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>IP address and port number of the RMI Registry on the server.
  A hostname may replace the IP address.</li>
<li>URL to the Java Platform API JavaDocs,
  if the network is isolated from the Internet.</li>
<li>URL to this exercise, optionally.</li>
</ul>

<dd>The program to test and fix. Usage instructions:

  Sources are in the jar,

<p>
Download the outlet program, <a href="dmoutlet-jrmi-faulty.jar"
                        ><code>dmoutlet-jrmi-faulty.jar</code></a>,
and give it a decent filename.
</p>

<p>
Run the program without arguments to obtain the usage instructions.
Read and understand those.
The commands correspond with operations for
<a href="direct-messages.html"
   title="high-level description of Direct Message functionality"
   >Direct Messages</a>.
</p>
<p class="larger">
To obtain tickets, use the Message Board client from above.

<h3 id="outlet-sequence">
  <span>Test Sequence</span>

</h3>

<p>
The outlet program supports two modes of operation.
On one hand, it can open an outlet and wait for direct messages.
On the other hand, it can make a remote call to an outlet or outlet manager.
For cooperation with your fellow students, please open an outlet
as soon as possible and keep it open while you work on the remote calls.
Last but not least, cleanup is required when closing an outlet.
For example, use the following test sequence:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Open an outlet, with a timespan of several minutes.
When that works, run the program in a dedicated terminal and
keep the outlet open for the remainder of the programming session,
or at least until you get to the cleanup part. Check the terminal
once in a while for direct messages from other students or the instructor.
</li>
<li>
List the usernames for published outlets.
Expect to see your own, maybe that of the instructor, and
those of other students that managed to open an outlet.
</li>
<li>
Send direct messages to the published outlets:
a single recipient, a list of recipients, or * for everyone.
Expect to deal with errors, because outlets may close
without removing their entry from the directory.
</li>
<li>
Unpublish your own outlet, before or after stopping
the program running in a dedicated terminal.
</li>
<li>
Open an outlet, for a few seconds only.
Make sure that the program closes the outlet and exits cleanly.
Note the difference between closing the outlet and unpublishing it.
</li>
<li>
Can you open more than one outlet at a time?
</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are four problems to fix in the code.
There are numerous problems in the application architecture,
but those are not the topic of this exercise.

</h2>

<p>
The <a href="jdoc/index.html" target="_blank">JavaDocs</a>
for this exercise are split into three groups.
The Remote API has some overlap with the Message Board exercise.
Direct Messages are all about this exercise.
The last group comprises support packages which are already known from
the Tutorial. The other packages are briefly described here.
</p>

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="code-RemoteAPI">
  <span>Remote API</span>
  <a href="#code-RemoteAPI" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>
The Remote API in <code>pityoulish.jrmi.api</code> defines the glue
which keeps <!--clients and server, -->outlets and senders together.
There are four interfaces for remotely callable objects,
they extend <code>java.rmi.Remote</code>.
Three of them are named <code>Remote*</code>, their objects will be
running on the server and can be looked up in the RMI registry.
The lookup names are defined by an enum, <code>RegistryNames</code>.
The fourth interface is <code>DirectMessageOutlet</code>,
its objects will be running on the machines of all the participants.
</p>

<p>
The remaining two interfaces in the Remote API describe
data that is passed in remote calls.
They extend <code>java.io.Serializable</code>, and
there are implementation classes in the Remote API.
This ensures that all participants can deserialize the objects.
Finally, the <code>APIException</code> is for reporting errors.
It is intentionally not derived from <code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code>,
to clearly distinguish Java RMI problems from application problems.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="code-DirectMessages">
  <span>Direct Messages</span>
  <a href="#code-DirectMessages" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>
Package <code>pityoulish.jrmi.outlet</code>
contains the logic for sending and receiving Direct Messages.
It relies on two interfaces of the Remote API.
<code>RemoteOutletManager</code> is provided by the server.
<code>DirectMessageOutlet</code> is both implemented and called
by this package.
<code>Main</code>, <code>MsgOutletCommandDispatcher</code>,
and <code>RegistryBackendHandler</code>
are similar to the Message Board client above.
</p>

<p>
The commands supported by the program are delegated to
<code>MsgOutletHandler</code>.
The handler uses <code>LocalOutletFactory</code> to open and close
a local <code>DirectMessageOutlet</code>.
All three interfaces have a single implementation class.
The outlet implementation simply checks arguments and
prints method invocations to the console.
</p>


<p style="background-color: red;"><!-- @@@ should be changed... -->
Logically, Direct Messages require the same ticket-related operations as
the Message Board client. To avoid code duplication, those commands which
call the <code>RemoteTicketIssuer</code> are not implemented here again.
Instead, use the Message Board client to obtain tickets.

</h2>

<p>
Did you get through both test sequences in time?
If not, where or how did you lose time?
</p>

<p>
How do you like coding on this level?
Compare to the exercise with sockets.
</p>

<p>
Which security gaps did you spot during the exercise?
Should those be addressed by the application, or by Java RMI?
</p>

<!--
Is there a sensible programming task in this context?
A long-running client, like for the sockets exercise, seems too dull.

This exercise is from <i>Pityoulish</i>,
an Open Source project hosted on GitHub.

     Don't want to point students there during the exercise :-)

If you want to help, you can submit Pull Requests
with improvements to the instructions or the code.
Among the Issues is a selection of smaller and bigger implementation tasks,
tagged with "help wanted". Most of them are about coding, but you can also
help with translations, by proof-reading, inventing new exercises, and more.
