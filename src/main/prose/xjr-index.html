Part 1: <a href="message-board.html">Message Board</a>
and
Part 2: <a href="direct-messages.html">Direct Messages</a>
</p>

<p>
Your task is to find and fix errors in a Java client program.
The client communicates with a <a href="message-board.html">Message Board</a>
server using Java Remote Method Invocation.
The server is operated by the instructor.
The client, when fixed, enables you to put messages on the board,
and to read the messages others have put there.
</p>

<p>
A recipe for solving this task has been conveyed beforehand in a Tutorial.
It was applied in a previous exercise with sockets in Java.
The development steps are assumed to be known by now.

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="setup"><span>Setup</span></h2>
<!--h2 id="prepare"><span>Prepare</span></h2-->

<p>
You already set up a Java development environment in the Tutorial.
Editor, Java compiler and tools, maybe an IDE, are readily available.
Good.
</p>

<p>
You already know how to access the instructions for this exercise,
because you're reading them. Good.
Other useful things you could open in separate browser tabs are
the Java Platform API specification (aka standard JavaDocs)
and the Tutorial instructions.
Where to find either depends on the network setup.
</p>

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="connectivity"><span>Network</span></h3>

<p>
Connect your computer to the network with the server, if you have not
done so already. The instructor provides all necessary information,
along with the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>IP address and port number of the RMI Registry on the server.
  A hostname may replace the IP address.</li>
<li>URL to the Java Platform API JavaDocs,
  if the network is isolated from the Internet.</li>
<li>URL to this exercise, optionally.</li>
<li>URL to the Tutorial, optionally.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="part1-mbclient"><span>Message Board Client</span></h2>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<h3 id="client-program"><span>Client</span></h3>
 -->

<div class="box-right">
<dl>
<dt><a href="mbclient-jrmi-faulty.jar"
       ><code>mbclient-jrmi-faulty.jar</code></a></dt>
<dd>The first program to test and fix. Usage instructions:
  <br/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;java -jar mbclient-jrmi-faulty.jar</code><br/>
  Sources are in the jar,
  <a href="jdoc/index.html" target="_blank">docs</a> here.
</dd>
</dl>
</div><!-- box-right -->

<p>
Download the client program, <a href="mbclient-jrmi-faulty.jar"
                        ><code>mbclient-jrmi-faulty.jar</code></a>,
and give it a decent filename.
Remember how important it is to keep a positive mindset:
<i>You will extirpate all faultiness.</i>
Start with the filename.
</p>

<p>
Run the client without arguments to obtain the usage instructions.
Read and understand those.
If you haven't done so already, read the high-level description
of the <a href="message-board.html">Message Board</a> now.
You will notice that the commands supported by the client
match with the operations defined for a Message Board.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="client-sequence"><span>Test Sequence</span></h3>

<p>
You can re-use your test sequence from the previous exercise
about the Message Board Client with sockets.
For example:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
List messages from the board, without marker.
</li>
<li>
Obtain a ticket.
</li>
<li>
Put some messages on the board.
</li>
<li>
List messages again, with and without marker.
Use different markers.
</li>
<li>
Return a ticket.
Use it again afterwards, to verify that it is no longer valid.
</li>
<li>
Replace a ticket, before and after exhausting all operations.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="part2-dmoutlet"><span>Direct Message Outlet</span></h2>

<h3 id="outlet-program"><span>Outlet</span></h3>
-->

<div class="box-right">
<dl>
<dt><a href="dmoutlet-jrmi-faulty.jar"
       ><code>dmoutlet-jrmi-faulty.jar</code></a></dt>
<dd>The second program to test and fix. Usage instructions:
  <br/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;java -jar dmoutlet-jrmi-faulty.jar</code><br/>
  Sources are in the jar,
  <a href="jdoc/index.html" target="_blank">docs</a> here.
</dd>
</dl>
</div><!-- box-right -->

<p>
Download the outlet program, <a href="dmoutlet-jrmi-faulty.jar"
                        ><code>dmoutlet-jrmi-faulty.jar</code></a>,
and give it a decent filename.
Remember how important it is to keep a positive mindset:
<i>You will extirpate all faultiness.</i>
Start with the filename.
</p>

<p>
Run the program without arguments to obtain the usage instructions.
Read and understand those.
If you haven't done so already, read the high-level description
of <a href="direct-messages.html">Direct Messages</a> now.
You will notice that the commands supported by the program
match with the operations defined for outlets and the outlet manager.
For obtaining tickets, use the Message Board client above.

</p>

<p>
Did you get through the full test sequence in time?
If not, where or how did you lose time?
</p>

<p>
Did you spot gaps in the suggested test sequence?
</p>

<p>
How do you like coding on this level?
Opening connections, building and parsing TLVs,...
</p>

<p>
Are the instructions in this exercise sufficiently clear?
If not, what was missing?
</p>

<p>
Were you well prepared by the Tutorial?
If not, because of the Tutorial or because you didn't complete it?
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="gimme-more"><span>Want some more?</span></h3>

<p>
To gain programming experience, you could implement a long-running client
that looks for new messages every few seconds.
<!--
When there are no new messages for a while, reduce the polling frequency.
When there is a new message, increase it again.
-->
If you do it in Java, you may re-use the classes from this exercise.
But you can also do it in Python, JavaScript, or a bunch of other languages.
All you need is a Socket API and Unicode support.
Ask the instructor for the server JAR, so you can test at home.
</p>

an Open Source project hosted on GitHub.

     Don't want to point students there during the exercise :-)

If you want to help, you can submit Pull Requests
with improvements to the instructions or the code.
Among the Issues is a selection of smaller and bigger implementation tasks,
tagged with "help wanted". Most of them are about coding, but you can also
help with translations, by proof-reading, inventing new exercises, and more.
