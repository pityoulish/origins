  <span>Exercise: Message Board Client with Sockets</span>
</h1>
<p class="abstract">
During this exercise, you will get a glimpse of what it means to
implement a low-level protocol interface on top of socket connections.
</p>

<div class="larger">
<p>
Your task is to <a href="test-fix-repeat.html">Test and Fix</a>
a Java client program. The client communicates with a
<a href="message-board.html"
   title="high-level description of Message Board functionality"
   >Message Board</a>
server using a
<a href="protocol-tlv.html"
   title="low-level description of protocol data units"
   >Binary Protocol</a>.
The server is operated by the instructor.
The client, when fixed, enables you to put messages on the board,
and to read the messages others have put there.
</p>

<p>
A recipe for solving this task has been conveyed beforehand in a Tutorial.
If you failed to work through the Tutorial, you're probably screwed now.
Unless you have experience with programming and debugging.

<p>
You already set up a Java development environment in the Tutorial.
Editor, Java compiler and tools, maybe an IDE, are readily available.
Good.
</p>

<p>
You already know how to access the instructions for this exercise,
because you're reading them. Good.
Other useful things you could open in separate browser tabs are
the Java Platform API specification (aka standard JavaDocs)
and the <a href="test-fix-repeat.html">Test and Fix</a> reminder.
Where to find the standard JavaDocs depends on the network setup.
</p>

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="connectivity">

  <a href="#connectivity" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>
Connect your computer to the network with the server, if you have not
done so already. The instructor provides all necessary information,
along with the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>IP address and port number of the Message Board server.
  A hostname may replace the IP address.</li>
<li>URL to the Java Platform API JavaDocs,
  if the network is isolated from the Internet.</li>
<li>URL to this exercise, optionally.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Download the client program, <a href="mbclient-sockets-faulty.jar"
                        ><code>mbclient-sockets-faulty.jar</code></a>,
and give it a decent filename.
Remember how important it is to keep a positive mindset:
<i>You will extirpate all faultiness.</i>
Start with the filename.
</p>

<p>
Run the client without arguments to obtain the usage instructions.
Read and understand those.
Each command corresponds with an operation of the

                   title="Find a Test Sequence"
                   >Test and Fix</a>,
finding a good test sequence requires some experience.
The following will take you through this exercise:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
List messages from the board, without marker.
</li>
<li>
Obtain a ticket.
</li>
<li>
Put some messages on the board.
</li>
<li>
List messages again, with and without marker.
Use different markers.
</li>
<li>
Return a ticket.
Use it again afterwards, to verify that it is no longer valid.
</li>
<li>
Replace a ticket, before and after exhausting all operations.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are four problems to find and fix.
Before hacking the code, get an
<a href="#code"
   title="Code Overview (below)"
   >overview</a>.
At some point, you will need a general understanding of nested
<a href="protocol-tlv.html#tlv"
   title="TLV section of the binary protocol"
   >TLV structures</a>.

<p>
If you completed the test sequence with time to spare,
write a more convenient client for posting messages.
You're welcome to re-use code from the exercise, of course.
Your new client should execute these steps in one go:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Obtain a token.
</li>
<li>
Post a message.
</li>
<li>
Return the token.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Open the <a href="jdoc/index.html" target="_blank">JavaDocs</a> for the client
and look at the list of packages. There are three groups.
In <code>pityoulish.sockets.client</code>, you will find the
<code>Main</code> class of the client, and the logic dealing with sockets.
Package <code>pityoulish.mbclient</code> defines the commands and
command-line arguments, it is independent of the transport protocol
and message format.
Package <code>pityoulish.sockets.tlv</code> contains TLV utility classes
for building and parsing the binary messages of the protocol.
They are needed by client and server alike, therefore the extra package.
The support packages,
<code>pityoulish.cmdline</code> and <code>pityoulish.i18n</code>,
are the same as in the Tutorial. There's no need to look at them now.
</p>

<p>
Select package <code>pityoulish.mbclient</code> and study the interfaces.
They are called <code>Handler</code>, and you remember that term
from the Tutorial. Read the package description.
It explains how the command-line arguments map to the handlers.
The <code>HostPortBackendHandler</code> records
the hostname and port to connect to.
The <code>MsgBoardClientHandler</code>
has one method for each command that the client supports.
The arguments match those that are expected on the command line.
That's all you need to know about the package at this point.
</p>

<p>
Move on to package <code>pityoulish.sockets.client</code>
and look at the package description.
It talks about protocol layers and briefly describes those.
There are pointers to classes for each layer,
and a distinction between sending and receiving.

When you reach the heading "Roll Your Own", stop reading.
You're not going to roll your own client now.
The package description did point to a base class and an implementation class
for the <code>MsgBoardClientHandler</code> interface,
so you know how the packages tie together.
That's enough for an overview.
</p>


<!-- Move this to an extra "Details" page? Or just forget about it?

<p>
If the package didn't have a useful description, the next step would be
to look at the interfaces (but not yet the classes) of the package.
<code>SocketBackendHandler</code> extends <code>HostPortBackendHandler</code>,
adding socket-specific methods.
The purposes of <code>RequestBuilder</code> and <code>ResponseParser</code>
are obvious from their name, although the latter does something funny
with a <code>Visitor</code>.
Never mind that detail now - you must get an <i>Overview</i>.
</p>

<p>
Now look where the handlers are implemented.
There is a single class for <code>SocketBackendHandler</code>, that's easy.
For <code>MsgBoardClientHandler</code>, there is a <code>Base</code> and
an <code>Impl</code> class.
The base class has attributes for several helper objects.
It implements all methods of the interface, but defines an abstract method
to fire requests. The abstract method gets a binary request as argument.
That means the base class uses its <code>RequestBuilder</code> to map
all the commands of the client to that abstract method.
The impl class implements the abstract method, and has extra methods
for sending requests and reading responses.
Those expect a socket as argument, so here you have found the IO logic.
</p>

<p>
From these brief observations, you know that different classes
are responsible for building requests, parsing responses, and
communicating over socket connections.
The client handler base class ties the helpers together.
The call path from the <code>Main</code> class through
packages <code>pityoulish.cmdline</code> and <code>pityoulish.mbclient</code>
into the client handler is of little interest.

<p>
Did you get through the full test sequence in time?
If not, where or how did you lose time?
</p>

<p>
Did you spot gaps in the test sequence?
</p>

<p>
How do you like coding on this level?
Opening connections, building and parsing TLVs,...
</p>

<p>
Are the instructions in this exercise sufficiently clear?
If not, what was missing?
</p>

<p>
Were you well prepared by the Tutorial?
If not, because of shortcomings in the Tutorial,
or because you didn't finish it?

<p>
To gain programming experience, you could implement a long-running client
that looks for new messages every few seconds.
<!--
When there are no new messages for a while, reduce the polling frequency.
When there is a new message, increase it again.
-->
If you do it in Java, you may re-use the classes from this exercise.
But you can also do it in Python, JavaScript, or a bunch of other languages.
All you need is a Socket API and Unicode support.
Ask the instructor for the server JAR, so you can test at home.
