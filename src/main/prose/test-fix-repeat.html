  <span>Test and Fix</span>
</h1>
<p class="abstract">
These are your main activities during a classroom exercise.
</br>
The prepared bugs will take you to selected, relevant places in the code.
</p>

<div class="larger">
<p>
The classroom exercises challenge you to find and fix errors in a program,
typically a Java client.
The corresponding server is operated by the instructor.
You manually execute a test sequence
and overcome errors as you encounter them.
This is the simplified version of a typical developer experience:
Working with an unfamiliar codebase.
You're pointed to some spot in the code, and have to make local changes
without fully understanding what everything around it does.

<h2 id="sequence"><span>Find a Test Sequence</span></h2>

<p>
The programs in the exercises are invoked with arguments that
tell them what to do.
Each program implements a set of commands with different arguments.
When a programm is called, it interprets the arguments,
performs the requested command, and prints the output.
Unless there is a problem, of course.
</p>

<p>
Many commands require output from others as arguments.
Sometimes, the output of a command depends on previous commands,
for example when reading data from a server after sending it there.
Testing the full program functionality therefore requires execution of all
commands in a logical sequence. Commands with different possible arguments,
or with different possible results, should be covered in all variations.
</p>

<p>
In practice, defining test cases which thoroughly cover a program or API
requires good knowledge of that program or API, and some experience.
To get you on track right away, the exercises suggest a test sequence.
That test sequence will cover the basic functionality of the program,
and uncover all prepared bugs, in the intended order.
Along the way, you will run into other problems,
like giving wrong arguments to a command.
That is part of the learning experience.
Those problems can be overcome without fixing the code.
</p>

<p>
The suggested test sequences cover all the commands, but
only some of the error cases the programs might run into.
They are probably also missing some of the good cases for the commands.
If you can spare the attention, look out for gaps in the test coverage.
If you are too occupied for that though, just following the test sequence
lets you achieve the main objective of each exercise nevertheless.
</p>

<h2 id="testfixbuild"><span>Test, Fix, Build, repeat</span></h2>

<p>
Start executing the test sequence, from the command line or your IDE.
Be prepared to deal with problems such as typos in command-line arguments,
incorrect usage of the program, network connectivity issues, and the like.
Resolve them and move on with the test sequence, until you
encounter a <code>pityoulish.outtake.Missing</code> exception.
</p>

<p>
That exception marks an intentional omission from the code.
Don't start fixing yet!
The first time you encounter the exception, make sure to
get a Code Overview from the JavaDocs before you dive into the sources.
</p>

<p>
OK, you've got a general understanding of the packages and classes
from the JavaDocs now. You found the classes from the stack trace there.
It's time to hit the source code, which is included in the JAR.
Locate where the exception is raised, where some code is missing.
Then stop and <b
title="If you invoke the auto-completion of your IDE and pick the
first method with a comely name, you're doing something wrong."
                >think</b>.
</p>

<!-- ............................................................ -->
<div class="side-note"><div class="content">
<span>Think!</span>
</div></div>

<ul>
<li>
What is the missing code supposed to do?
There is an exception message, probably some comment in the source code,
JavaDocs of the method.
</li>
<li>
What result is expected?
A value returned? An attribute initialized? A method called?
Output written to the console?
</li>
<li>
What data do you need? What data is available?
Look at local variables, method arguments, object attributes,
functions inherited from base classes.
</li>
<li>
How can you solve the problem?
Is there a standard API to use, or something in the program code?
</li>
<li>
Where can you copy from?
Are there other places in the program that do something similar?
It's OK to re-use code snippets from there.
</li>
<li>
<b>Keep it simple!</b>
There's usually just one or two lines missing.
An assignment, a method call, something like that.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Remove the call that raises the exception and fill in the missing code.
Compile the sources and build a new JAR that includes your fix.
Repeat the failing step of the test sequence,
and prerequisite steps if necessary.
If your fix is good, proceed with the test sequence.
If not, improve your fix.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="cleanup"><span>Clean Up</span></h2>

<p>
After completing the test sequence, perform the final cleanup.
Delete the package <code>pityoulish.outtake</code>, both source and classes.
Delete the <code>.class</code> files from all other packages.
Then compile the whole program from source code again.
Fix compilation problems, and then you're done.
