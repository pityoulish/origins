<p class="abstract">
The Pityoulish exercises assume that you are somewhat familiar with Java.
<br/>
In case you are not as familiar as you'd like to be, here are some tips.
</p>

<div class="larger">
This page collects entry-level information for working with Java,
in particular with the codebase of Pityoulish exercises.
You should already know Java syntax and
the basics of object-oriented programming.
The descriptions are intended to refresh things you might have forgotten,
or to close small gaps in your training.
Experienced Java developers will not learn anything new here.

<p>

<p>
Call the command again, to have a closer look at the error message
and the stack trace. Details such as line numbers probably differ
from the example output. Work with what you see in your command-line terminal,
because that matches with the source code in your JAR.
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>java -jar tutorial.jar islocal localhost</span></div>
  <div class="output"
>Exception in thread "main" pityoulish.outtake.Missing: <span class="emph">bind a socket to a hostname</span>
	at pityoulish.outtake.Missing.here(Missing.java:31)
	at pityoulish.tutorial.TutorialCommandHandler.<span class="emph">handleIsLocalCmd(TutorialCommandHandler.java:159)</span>
	at pityoulish.tutorial.TutorialCommandHandler.handleCommand(TutorialCommandHandler.java:92)
	at pityoulish.tutorial.TutorialCommandHandler.handleCommand(TutorialCommandHandler.java:26)
	at pityoulish.cmdline.CommandHandlerBase.handle(CommandHandlerBase.java:76)
	at pityoulish.cmdline.ArgsInterpreter.handle(ArgsInterpreter.java:88)
	at pityoulish.tutorial.Main.main(Main.java:27)
</div>

<p>
The first line reveals the class of the exception and the exception message.
The class often indicates the type of problem, for example
a <code>NullPointerException</code> or an <code>IOException</code>.
In this case, some code is missing; you already know that.
The message tells you what the missing code is supposed to do.
We'll get to that later, once you've found the place where it is missing.
</p>
<p>
The lines starting with "at" are the call stack.
The program execution started at <code>main</code>, which is in the last line.
<code>main</code> called <code>ArgsInterpreter.handle</code>,
which called <code>CommandHandlerBase.handle</code>,
which called something else, and so on,
right up to <code>Missing.here</code> at the top of the stack.
And there, the exception was thrown. In parenthesis, you see
the source file name 'Missing.java' and a line number.
Open the file and find the line indicated by your stack trace.
If you executed the command from within an IDE,
you probably just have to click a link in the output.
Now what is wrong in <code>here</code>?
</p>

<p>
Well, nothing is wrong in <code>Missing.here</code>.
It is a helper method meant to throw an exception, and so it does.
The caller must have found that something is wrong
and raised an exception by invoking the helper.
You need to find the code that called here.
Luckily, the second line of the stack trace tells you exactly where that is.
Load the file 'TutorialCommandHandler.java' and
have a look at method <code>handleIsLocalCmd</code>,
especially around the line number from your stack trace.
There you'll see the following statements:
</p>
<div class="code">
  Missing.here("bind a socket to a hostname");
  Missing.pretend(IOException.class);
</div>
