The Pityoulish exercises assume that you are somewhat familiar with Java.
<br/>
In case you are not as familiar as I'd like you to be, here are some tips.
</p>

<div class="larger">
This page collects entry-level information for working with Java,
in particular with the codebase of Pityoulish exercises.
You should already know Java syntax and
the basics of object-oriented programming.
The descriptions are intended to refresh things you might have forgotten,
or to close small gaps in your training.
Experienced Java developers will not learn anything new here.

<h2 id="stack-trace"><span>Stack Traces</span></h2>

<p>
A stack trace is usually part of an exception.
An exception indicates a problem or an error condition in the program flow.
(If you're using exceptions for good cases, you're doing something ugly.)
The stack trace shows where the problem was detected,
and how the program execution got to that point.
Consider this example from the Tutorial:
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="output"
>Exception in thread "main" pityoulish.outtake.Missing: <span class="emph">bind a socket to a hostname</span>
	at pityoulish.outtake.Missing.here(Missing.java:31)
	at pityoulish.tutorial.TutorialCommandHandler.<span class="emph">handleIsLocalCmd(TutorialCommandHandler.java:159)</span>
	at pityoulish.tutorial.TutorialCommandHandler.handleCommand(TutorialCommandHandler.java:92)
	at pityoulish.tutorial.TutorialCommandHandler.handleCommand(TutorialCommandHandler.java:26)
	at pityoulish.cmdline.CommandHandlerBase.handle(CommandHandlerBase.java:76)
	at pityoulish.cmdline.ArgsInterpreter.handle(ArgsInterpreter.java:88)
	at pityoulish.tutorial.Main.main(Main.java:27)
</div>
</div>

<p>
The first line provides information about the problem,
the subsequent lines are the stack trace.
The information in the first line is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The thread which encountered the problem.
  The Java clients of the Pityoulish exercises are single-threaded,
  so this will always be "main".
</li>
<li>The class of the exception.
  Different classes are used for different types of problems.
  <br/>
  Class <code>pityoulish.outtake.Missing</code> indicates 
  an intentional bug in the Pityoulish exercises,
  an omission which you have to fill in.
</li>
<li>The exception message, which may be empty.
  The intentional bugs come with a message that tells you what is missing.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The subsequent lines, all starting with an indented "at", are the stack trace.
Each method invocation in Java allocates some memory on the stack,
a stack frame. The stack trace is a list of the methods which
currently hold a stack frame:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The exception in the example was created in
  class <code>pityoulish.outtake.Missing</code>,
  method <code>here</code>,
  source file <code>Missing.java</code>, line 31.
</li>
<li>That method was called from
  class <code>pityoulish.tutorial.TutorialCommandHandler</code>,
  method <code>handleIsLocalCmd</code>,
  source file <code>TutorialCommandHandler.java</code>, line 159.
</li>
<li>... <i>and so on</i> ...
</li>
<li>
  Method <code>main</code> in class <code>pityoulish.tutorial.Main</code>
  is the entry point of the program.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The place where an exception is created can be different from where it
gets thrown. And typically, neither of these are the actual location
of the problem, but rather where the problem eventually surfaces.
In the example, <code>Missing.here</code> is just a helper method for
throwing the exception. Nothing is missing <i>there</i>.
You need to look at the place where <code>Missing.here</code> gets called.
<!--
</p>
<p>
-->
The line numbers you encounter are different from those in the example above.
Always work with the line numbers that your program prints,
because those match with the source code bundled in the JAR,
or with your modifications to that.
An IDE will quickly take you to the indicated line in the source file.
</p>

<p>
When looking for the cause of an exception, start at the place where
the exception was created, and work through the stack trace from there.
It's a waste of time and effort to start at the main entry point,
trying to follow the program flow all the way to the problem.
<!--
</p>
<p>
-->
If you are familiar with the package structure of the source code,
you can often skip many lines in a stack trace.
For example, if you encounter a <code>FileNotFoundException</code>,
the stack trace starts in a package for accessing files,
which may have been called from a library for parsing a file format.
But if you are looking for the place in your program where
the filename is computed, you can skip all foreign stack frames,
until you reach one from a package of your program.

<h2 id="available-data"><span>Available Data</span></h2>

<p>
When you jump into unfamiliar code and are required to make changes at
a particular location, you need to understand what data you have available
at that location.
In an ungraded exercise, you might get away with hard-coding a hostname
instead of using the value passed as command-line argument.
But that is not the way in which you should tackle problems,
and taking such shortcuts will compromise your learning.
</p>
<p>
Here is a selection of data that your code can access, sorted by
increasing "distance" from where you have to make a change.
IDEs may provide lists of accessible attributes and methods
through auto-completion, but don't rely exclusively on that.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Local variables and method arguments</dt>
<dd>
  Scroll up to the method signature. Look for arguments passed to the method,
  and for local variables initialized within the method.
  Existing code might already look up or compute relevant data.
</dd>

<dt>Object attributes, getters, and constructor arguments</dt>
<dd>
  Look at the attributes and getter methods defined by the class.
  If the method is static, you can only access and call static attributes
  and methods. Otherwise, your method is part of an object and can access
  and call all members of the class.
  Object attributes can be initialized from constructor arguments, for example.
</dd>

<dt>Interface constants and methods, recursively</dt>
<dd>
  Look at the interfaces of your class, and of its base class,
  and the base interfaces of these interfaces, and so on.
<!--
  Look at the interfaces of your class, and of your base classes,
  and the base interfaces of these interfaces.
-->
  An interface cannot define attributes, but it can define useful constants,
  and getters for attributes in implementation classes.
</dd>

<dt>Base class attributes and getters, recursively</dt>
<dd>
  Look at the base class of your class, and its base class, and so on.
  Your code can access public and protected members of these.
</dd>


<div class="box-center">
<span class="header">
<span class="title">Warning</span>
<span class="abstract"
      >Don't get lost!</span>
</span><!-- header -->
<span class="content">
Focus on the problem you have to solve,
look only for the data required to solve it.
Don't get distracted by things not relevant to your problem,
no matter how interesting they seem to be.
In simple classes, start with the local variables, method arguments,
object attributes, constructor arguments.
Look further only if you need to.
In complicated classes, even that might be too much.
</span>
</div>


<dt>Package</dt>
<dd>
  The package of your class may define classes with static methods,
  or with a singleton instance, and interfaces with useful constants.
</dd>

<dt>Referenced Objects</dt>
<dd>
  Some objects just represent values, like strings or numbers.
  Other objects may provide public getter methods or attributes of their own,
  as defined by their interfaces and classes.
  Look at the import statements in your class, then in its interfaces and
  base classes. These are the most likely candidates.
</dd>

<dt>Imported Packages</dt>
<dd>
  Similar to the package of your class, other packages of may define
  classes with static methods, or with a singleton instance,
  and interfaces with useful constants.
  Look at the import statements in the interfaces and classes of your package.
  These are the most likely candidates.
