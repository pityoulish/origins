<p class="abstract">
The Pityoulish exercises assume that you are somewhat familiar with Java.
<br/>
In case you are not as familiar as you'd like to be, here are some tips.
</p>

<div class="larger">
This page collects entry-level information for working with Java,
in particular with the codebase of Pityoulish exercises.
You should already know Java syntax and
the basics of object-oriented programming.
The descriptions are intended to refresh things you might have forgotten,
or to close small gaps in your training.
Experienced Java developers will not learn anything new here.

<h2 id="stack-trace"><span>Stack Traces</span></h3>

<p>
A stack trace is usually part of an exception.
An exception indicates a problem or an error condition in the program flow.
(If you're using exceptions for good cases, you're doing something ugly.)
The stack trace shows where the problem was detected,
and how the program execution got to that point.
Consider this example from the Tutorial:
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="output"
>Exception in thread "main" pityoulish.outtake.Missing: <span class="emph">bind a socket to a hostname</span>
	at pityoulish.outtake.Missing.here(Missing.java:31)
	at pityoulish.tutorial.TutorialCommandHandler.<span class="emph">handleIsLocalCmd(TutorialCommandHandler.java:159)</span>
	at pityoulish.tutorial.TutorialCommandHandler.handleCommand(TutorialCommandHandler.java:92)
	at pityoulish.tutorial.TutorialCommandHandler.handleCommand(TutorialCommandHandler.java:26)
	at pityoulish.cmdline.CommandHandlerBase.handle(CommandHandlerBase.java:76)
	at pityoulish.cmdline.ArgsInterpreter.handle(ArgsInterpreter.java:88)
	at pityoulish.tutorial.Main.main(Main.java:27)
</div>
</div>

<p>
The first line provides information about the problem,
the subsequent lines are the stack trace.
The information in the first line is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The thread which encountered the problem.
  The Java clients of the Pityoulish exercises are single-threaded,
  so this will always be "main".
</li>
<li>The class of the exception.
  Different classes are used for different types of problems.
  <br/>
  Class <code>pityoulish.outtake.Missing</code> indicates 
  an intentional bug in the Pityoulish exercises,
  an omission which you have to fill in.
</li>
<li>The exception message, which may be empty.
  The intentional bugs come with a message that tells you what is missing.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The subsequent lines, all starting with an indented "at", are the stack trace.
Each method invocation in Java allocates some memory on the stack,
a stack frame. The stack trace is a list of the methods which
currently hold a stack frame:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The exception in the example was created in
  class <code>pityoulish.outtake.Missing</code>,
  method <code>here</code>,
  source file <code>Missing.java</code>, line 31.
</li>
<li>That method was called from
  class <code>pityoulish.tutorial.TutorialCommandHandler</code>,
  method <code>handleIsLocalCmd</code>,
  source file <code>TutorialCommandHandler.java</code>, line 159.
</li>
<li>... <i>and so on</i> ...
</li>
<li>
  Method <code>main</code> in class <code>pityoulish.tutorial.Main</code>
  is the entry point of the program.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The place where an exception is created can be different from where it
gets thrown. And typically, neither of these are the actual location
of the problem, but rather where the problem eventually surfaces.
In the example, <code>Missing.here</code> is just a helper method for
throwing the exception. Nothing is missing <i>there</i>.
You need to look at the place where <code>Missing.here</code> gets called.
<!--
</p>
<p>
-->
The line numbers you encounter are different from those in the example above.
Always work with the line numbers that your program prints,
because those match with the source code from which it was compiled.
An IDE will quickly take you to the indicated locations in the source code.
</p>

<p>
When looking for the cause of an exception, start at the place where
the exception was created, and work through the stack trace from there.
It's a waste of time and effort to start at the main entry point,
trying to follow the program flow all the way to the problem.
<!--
</p>
<p>
-->
If you are familiar with the package structure of the source code,
you can sometimes skip many lines in a stack trace.
For example, if you encounter a <code>FileNotFoundException</code>,
the stack trace starts in a package for accessing files,
which may have been called from a library for parsing a file format,
each with several stack frames. But if you are looking for
the place in your program where the filename is computed,
you can skip all packages that are not from your program.
