<p>
If you're an experienced Java developer, all of this will be familiar to you.
But many students in my classes are not. This tutorial establishes a baseline
of required tools and skills for the classroom exercises.
</p>
</div>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="prereqs"><span>Prerequisites</span></h2>

<p>
To work through the exercises from the command line, you need a web browser,
a text editor, and a Java Development Kit (JDK).
If available for your platform, you can use the OpenJDK.
Beware of the Oracle Java installers for Windows and OS X, they have a
reputation for installing adware along with the Java browser plug-in.
</p>
<p>
Execute the following commands to verify that a JDK is available:
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>java -version</span></div>
  <div class="input"><span>javac -version</span></div>
</div>

<p>
If you prefer to code with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE),
there are several that support Java development.
<br/>
For example
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/"
   title="IntelliJ IDEA - Community Edition"
   >IntelliJ</a>,
<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/"
   title="Eclipse IDE for Java Developers"
   >Eclipse</a>,
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java"
   title="Visual Studio Code"
   >Visual Studio Code</a>, or
<a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html"
   title="NetBeans - Java SE"
   >NetBeans</a>.
</p>


<p>
For convenience, bookmark the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/"
   >Java SE API</a> documentation of the Java version you are using.
<br/>
When working from the command line, collect frequently used commands
in a text file for copy&amp;paste.
</p>



<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="setup"><span>Setup</span></h2>

<div class="box-right">
<dl>
<dt><a href="tutorial-faulty.jar"><code>tutorial-faulty.jar</code></a></dt>
<dd>The program to test and fix. Usage instructions:
  <div><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;java -jar tutorial-faulty.jar</code></div>
  Sources are in the jar,
  <a href="jdoc/index.html" target="_blank">docs</a> here.
</dd>
</dl>
</div><!-- box-right -->

<p>
Download the file
<a href="tutorial-faulty.jar"><code>tutorial-faulty.jar</code></a>
and save it with a decent filename. In the remainder of this Tutorial,
the name <code>tutorial.jar</code> is assumed.
While the JAR is faulty now, it won't be when you're done with it.
Using a filename without negative connotation supports
a positive mindset right from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
Run the program to verify the download.
It is an executable JAR file, so you don't have to specify a class name.
This should print usage instructions, which you will need later on:
</p>

<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>java -jar tutorial.jar</span></div>
</div>

<p>
If you're not familiar with JAR files, have a look at the content now.
They are similar to zip archives, with some extra conventions for storing
and executing Java classes. If you need more guidance, read the
<a href="more-tutorial.html#jar">detailed description</a>
of the JAR file content.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to prepare for changing the code
and building your own version of the JAR file.
<br/>
How to do that depends on the IDE you are using, if any.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, verify that the program is using
the correct character encoding for input and output.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="setup-ide"><span>IDE</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">
How to perform the steps in this section depends on the IDE you have chosen.
<br/>
You're welcome to contribute specific instructions
for other users of your IDE.
</p>

<p>
Create a project from the downloaded JAR file.
Not from extracted sources, but from the JAR itself.
<br/>
Make sure that the name of your project does <i>not</i> contain "faulty".
</p>

<p>
Build or export a new JAR file from your project.
<br/>
Run your own JAR and verify that it prints the expected usage information.
If it doesn't, read the
<a href="more-tutorial.html#jar-trouble">troubleshooting tips</a>.
</p>

<p>
For development, you may also run the program directly from the IDE.
The final result should be a JAR file though.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="setup-cmdline"><span>Command Line</span></h3>

<p>
Create a new directory to work in, for example <code>tutorial-project/</code>.
Make sure that the name of your directory does <i>not</i> contain "faulty".
<br/>
Use <code>cd</code> to change there.
All command-line examples assume that this is your current directory.
</p>

<p>
Extract the contents of the downloaded JAR file:
</p>

<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>jar -xvf /path/to/tutorial.jar</span></div>
</div>

<p>
Subdirectory <code>pityoulish/</code> contains the
source code, properties files, and compiled classes.
<br/>
Subdirectory <code>META-INF/</code> can be ignored or deleted.
</p>

<p>
After changing a Java source file, you have to recompile it.
<br/>
For example, after editing
<code>pityoulish/tutorial/TutorialCommandHandler.java</code>,
compile it with:
</p>

<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>javac pityoulish/tutorial/TutorialCommandHandler.java</span></div>
</div>

<p>
Build a new JAR from your working directory:
</p>

<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>jar -cfe tutorial.jar pityoulish.tutorial.Main pityoulish/</span></div>
</div>

<p>
Run your own JAR and verify that it prints the expected usage information.
If it doesn't, read the
<a href="more-tutorial.html#jar-trouble">troubleshooting tips</a>.
</p>

<p>
You will have to compile a source file and build a new JAR several times.
Either use the command line history to access previously executed commands,
or prepare commands for copy&amp;paste in an editor.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="setup-charset"><span>Character Encoding</span></h3>

<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>java -jar tutorial.jar latin</span></div>
  <div class="input"><span>java -jar tutorial.jar latin <i>your input</i></span></div>
</div>

<i>
<ul>
<li>check that umlauts are displayed correctly</li>
<li>check that non-ASCII input is echoed correctly</li>
<li><a href="more-tutorial.html">troubleshooting tips</a></li>
</ul>
</i>




<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="exercise"><span>Exercise</span></h2>

<p>
The main loop of an exercise is to manually execute a test sequence
and to overcome the problems you encounter.
Some problems will be your own mistakes, like passing wrong arguments
to a command or connecting to the wrong network.
Some problems are intentional bugs in the code, which you have to fix.
</p>

<p>
The information here is specific to this Tutorial.
A general description for the exercises is in
<a href="test-fix-repeat.html">Test and Fix</a>.
</p>



<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="test-sequence"><span>Test</span></h3>

<p>
The commands supported by the tutorial program are independent of eachother.
You could test them in any order.
<br/>
The usage instructions suggest this sequence:
</p>

<ol>
<li><code>local</code></li>
<li><code>islocal</code></li>
<li><code>lookup</code></li>
</ol>

<p>
There are two problems to find and fix.
<br/>
The command <code>latin</code> is not part of the exercise.
It is provided only for the setup in section
<a href="#setup-charset">Character Encoding</a> above.
</p>

<p>
Read the usage instructions for each command and try it out.
If you encounter a <code>pityoulish.outtake.Missing</code> exception,
you found one of the intentional bugs.
All other problems originate from your environment or input.
Solve those without changing code.
</p>



<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="think"><span>Think</span></h3>

<p>
The stack traces lead you directly to the bugs in the code.
<br/>
<b>But</b> you are not familiar with the codebase yet.
<br/>
Before you even look at the source code,
get an <a href="#code">overview</a>.
</p>

<p>
Once you have an overview, follow a stack trace
to the point where some code is missing.
</p>
<ul>
<li>In which part of the codebase are you?</li>
<li>What is supposed to happen at this point?</li>
<li>What data is available here?</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you'd like more guidance, there are descriptions for
interpreting <a href="java-refresher.html#stack-trace">stack traces</a>
and for <a href="java-refresher.html#available-data">available data</a>
at a point in the code.
</p>



<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="fix"><span>Fix</span></h3>

<p>
Read the exception message, and the comments in the code.
What is it you have to do?
Initialize an attribute? Assign a variable? Modify a data structure?
Return a value? Call a method? A combination of these?
<a href="#think">Think!</a>
</p>

<p>
Is there another method that does something similar?
Go there, see how it's done, and copy shamelessly.
</p>

<p>
Remove the calls to class <code>Missing</code> at the point of the problem.
Put in your code snippet instead.
Sometimes you can make the code prettier by combining your snippet
with commands before or after. But that's not necessary.
</p>

<p>
If you cannot figure out how to fix the prepared problems, there is help
for <a href="more-tutorial.html#help-islocal"><code>islocal</code></a>
and <a href="more-tutorial.html#help-lookup"><code>lookup</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
Save your changes and compile the file.
IDEs often do that automatically.
When working with the command line, use <code>javac</code>
as explained <a href="#setup-cmdline" title="Setup: Command Line">above</a>.
Fix compiler errors.
</p>

<p>
Create a new JAR and repeat your tests. If the bug is fixed, continue
with testing until you've found and eliminated all intentional bugs.
</p>



<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="clean-up"><span>Clean Up</span></h3>

<p>
Once you've fixed the prepared problems, class <code>Missing</code>
is no longer needed.
It was just an artifice to lead you to the intentional bugs.
That's why it was left out of the generated
<a href="jdoc/index.html" target="_blank">JavaDocs</a>.
</p>

<p>
Delete the directory <code>pityoulish/outtake/</code> from your project,
both source code and compiled class.
Then recompile all remaining classes and fix compiler errors.
This will detect unused imports of class <code>Missing</code>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, create a new JAR.
<p/>

<h2 id="code"><span>Code Overview</span></h2>

<p class="larger">
Do <b>not</b> look at the source code!
It's too easy to get lost in it.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="code-jdoc"><span>JavaDocs</span></h3>

<p>
Open the <a href="jdoc/index.html" target="_blank">JavaDocs</a> in the browser.
There's a short description for each package.
Read the package name and description.
<br/>
Optionally, select the package and start reading the long description.
Do you need to know more to solve the problem at hand?
</p>

<p>
Select a package you're interested in, in the main frame.
<br/>
Read enough of the description to grasp what the purpose is.
</p>

<p>
Look at the lists of interfaces, classes, and enums in the package.
<br/>
Read the names and short descriptions.
Do you need to know more to solve the problem at hand?
</p>

<p>
Select an interface, class, or enum you're interested in, in the main frame.
<br/>
Read the description.
Optionally, look at the lists of methods, attributes, or constants.
<br/>
Optionally, select one of those and read its description.
</p>

<p>
