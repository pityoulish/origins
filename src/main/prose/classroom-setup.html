  <span>Classroom Setup</span>
</h1>
<p class="abstract">
All Pityoulish classroom exercises share a common setup:
students connect to the instructor's server;
server output appears on a public screen.
Below are instructions to establish this setup
and to run an exercise, including preparation and debriefing.
</p>

<div class="larger">
<p>
The first two sections are about technical aspects,
the other two about organization.

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="procure"><span>What You Need</span></h2><!-- Ingredients -->

<dl>
<dt>Server Machine</dt>
<dd class="todo">
Any Netbook will have sufficient performance.
Video output (HDMI, VGA?) to connect to projector or other shared display.
</dd>

<dt>Server Runtime</dt>
<dd class="todo">
Depends on the exercise: JVM, Node.js, Python,...
If you're not on x86 (Linux or Windows), better double-check availability.
</dd>

<dt>Network</dt>
<dd class="todo">
Wireless access point without Internet connection will do.
Might even be better than having an Internet connection:
less distraction, no access to Pityoulish sources.
With students working in pairs, one can connect to the server
while the other does online research.
</dd>

<dt>Web Server</dt>
<dd class="todo">
Local web server with exercise and related documentation;
optional if Internet connection is available.
Server software with suitable runtime, depending on the exercise.
</dd>

<dt>Client Machine</dt>
<dd class="todo">
<i>Only for the rehearsal, but you MUST rehearse.</i>
Some problems only occur if the client actually runs on a different machine.
</dd>
</dl>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="rehearse"><span>Rehearse</span></h2>

<p>
Tech Rehearsal to avoid pitfalls.
<a href="https://notalwaysworking.com/all-the-worlds-a-rage/30673"
   >Anecdote</a>.
There's also a Content Rehearsal for each exercise, see there.
</p>

<ul class="todo">
<li>
Connect server to network. Look up IP address or hostname.
</li>
<li>
Start web server.
Connect client to network.
Access web server from client: Exercise, related documentation.
Use IP address or hostname in URL? http or https?
</li>
<li>
Start exercise-specific server in terminal.
Fixed port or random port?
Access server from other machine.
Use IP address or hostname? Firewall in the way?
</li>
<li>
Connect server to projector or other shared display.
Do you get a picture?
Need to adjust graphic adapter settings?
Mirror display or extend desktop?
</li>
<li>
Move terminal to shared display.
Adjust window size, 80 columns or more recommended.
Output readable from the back row?
Adjust font size and colors.
</li>
<li>
Where will you put auxiliary for the students?
Whiteboard, blackboard, flipchart that is not blocked by the projection screen?
An extra window on the projected screen?
Can't use the server terminal, that will scroll off.
</li>
</ul>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="schedule"><span>Schedule</span></h2>

<p>
Big scale: Term.
</p>

<ul class="todo">
<li>
Do the students need to prepare?
Hand out a Tutorial, reading list or preparation exercise well in advance,
one or two weeks.
</li>
<li>
You need to prepare even better than the students,
so you can help them when they run into problems.
Do not underestimate this!
</li>
<li>
What topics are you going to teach in advance?
What are you going to teach immediately before and after the exercise?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Small scale: Lesson.
</p>

<ul class="todo">
<li>
How much time for programming in-class? 60 minutes, 45 minutes?
</li>
<li>
How much time for discussions afterwards?
Make sure you have room to spare if things go wrong.
Make sure you have other material prepared, if things go smoothly.
</li>
<li>
How to form groups of 2 to 3 students? Neighbors, random, other?
How much time to form groups?
</li>
</ul>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="evaluate"><span>Lessons Learned</span></h2>

<ul class="todo">
<li>
Gather feedback from the students immediately after the exercise,
and again a few weeks later in hindsight.
</li>
<li>
Found out something you want to write down for the next time?
</li>
<li>
Found out something that might be useful to others?
Please share upstream.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please provide feedback, positive and negative, to the Open Source project at
