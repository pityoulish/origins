  <span>Classroom Setup</span>
</h1>
<p class="abstract">
All Pityoulish classroom exercises share a common setup:
students connect to the instructor's server;
server output appears on a public screen.
Below are instructions to establish this setup
and to run an exercise, including preparation and debriefing.
</p>

<div class="larger">
<p>
The first two sections are about technical aspects,
the other two about organization.

<h2 id="procure">
  <span>What You Need</span>
  <a href="#procure" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Server Machine</dt>
<dd>
Even a Netbook will have sufficient computing power and memory
for running the server software. The machine needs video output,
so that you can connect it to a projector or other public display.
Check which connector (HDMI, VGA), cables, or adapters you need.
</dd>

<dt>Server Runtime</dt>
<dd>
As of 2016, the required server runtime is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
or better a Java Development Kit (JDK). Future enhancements might add
components for Node.js, Python, or other runtimes.
If your server machine is an x86 architecture running Linux, Windows,
or MacOS, these runtimes are readily available.
If you're on another architecture, for example a Raspberry Pi,
better double-check the availability of the runtimes you require.
</dd>

<dt>Network</dt>
<dd>
A wireless access point, without Internet connection,
should be enough to serve a dozen groups of students or more.&sup1;
When working in groups, students can still do online research from a
different machine than the one connected to the exercise network.
If they wanted to cheat by accessing the Pityoulish source code,
you couldn't stop them anyway.
<br>
If you prefer to use an on-site network in the classroom,
either wired or wireless, verify that there are no firewalls
that would prevent the student machines from connecting to your server,
or to eachother.
<p>&sup1;)
<i>In 2016, the corporate laptop of one student acted up though,
complaining about "limited availability" of the network.</i>
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Web Server</dt>
<dd>
The Pityoulish exercises are packaged for presentation on a web server.
If the exercise network has no Internet connection, you should run a
web server on the server machine. Otherwise, you can upload the material
on any public web server.
The content students need to access are the exercises themselves,
and required documentation such as the standard JavaDocs.
The exercises can also be downloaded as a zip file and extracted locally,
for browsing with a <code>file:</code> URL.
</dd>

<dt>Client Machine</dt>
<dd>
A dedicated client machine is required only for the rehearsal,
but you MUST rehearse. Some network related problems, like a wrong hostname
or IP address in an RMI stub, will only occur if you run the client code
on a different machine than the server component.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="rehearse">
  <span>Rehearse</span>
  <a href="#rehearse" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>
Described here is the
<a href="https://notalwaysright.com/all-the-worlds-a-rage/59152/"
   class="covert"
   >Tech Rehearsal</a>,
to sort out problems with cables, network, and the like.
Once completed, you should be fine with the technical aspects
until you change the classroom or some of your equipment.
But there are also Content Rehearsals specific to each exercise.
You need to run those, too.
</p>

  <span>Network</span>
  <a href="#rehearse-network" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h3>

<ol>
<li>
If you are running your own wireless access point, start it up.
What's the WLAN name and password that students need to connect?
Do you need to configure the firewall or other security options
of the access point?
</li>
<li>
Connect the server machine to the network, wired or wireless.
What's the hostname or IP address that students need to contact?
</li>
<li>
What's the URL to the exercise and other information that students need?
Do you have a landing page from which all the rest is linked?
If you provide the information on a local web server, start it now.
</li>
<li>
Start the exercise-specific server in a terminal.
What's the port number that students need to connect to?
This is actually part of the Content Rehearsal, see
the Instructor's Notes of the exercise for details.
</li>
<li>
Connect a client machine to the network.
This <i>must</i> be a different machine, so that you are actually
testing the network rather than machine-local connections.
</li>
<li>
From the client machine, access the web server. Make sure that
the exercise description as well as other required information is accessible.
</li>
<li>
From the client machine, access the exercise-specific server.
Again, this is part of the Content Rehearsal, see
the Instructor's Notes of the exercise for details.
</li>
</ol>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="rehearse-display">
  <span>Display</span>
  <a href="#rehearse-display" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Connect the server machine to the projector,
or another public display in the classroom.
Do you have to adjust desktop settings?
Mirror the display, extend the desktop, or use only the external display?
</li>
<li>
Move the terminal of the exercise-specific server to the public display.
If you need other windows on the public display, open them now.
For example, a terminal running a Follow-the-Board client.
This is part of the Content Rehearsal, see
the Instructor's Notes of the exercise for details.
</li>
<li>
Make sure that each terminal is at least 80 columns wide.
Arrange the windows.
Adjust the font size and colors, so that output is readable from the back row.
</li>
<li>
How will you provide the network information and URL to the students?
Whiteboard, blackboard, flipchart?
They might be obstructed by the projection screen.
You can't use the server terminal, information would scroll off.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="schedule">
  <span>Schedule</span>
  <a href="#schedule" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>
At which points during the term are you planning the classroom exercises?
The students need to work through the Tutorial first.
Is there additional reading or preparation you expect of them?
For programming in general, or for specific exercises?
Make sure to hand out such assignments some time in advance.
</p>

<p>
When do you intend to teach non-programming topics
related to the classroom exercises?
Will you use the exercises as introduction,
put the programming after the theory,
or interleave both in the same classroom session?
</p>

<p>
When can you make time for your own <a href="#rehearse">rehearsals</a>?
Do not underestimate this! You must rehearse.
</p>

<p>
On the days with classroom exercises, plan a huge slot for discussions.
You might need it because students don't progress as fast as you would
have thought, or are missing some knowledge that you assumed implicitly.
Still, prepare an optional topic as well, in case everything goes smoothly
and you have some time left.
</p>

<p>
How will you form work groups of two or three students?
Those sitting next to eachother will group easily, but
you might end up with some students working alone.
Do you want the same groups for each programming session,
or do you want to mix groups over the term?
If students need to change seats, plan in some extra time
for replugging the laptops.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="evaluate">
  <span>Lessons Learned</span>
  <a href="#evaluate" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>
Gather feedback from the students immediately after the classroom exercises.
And again at the end of the term, with hindsight.
Record their feedback as well as your own observations in writing,
for the next time.
</p>

<p>
Did you learn something that might be useful to others?
Please provide feedback, positive or negative, to the Open Source project at
<a href="https://github.com/rolandweber/pityoulish/"
   >https://github.com/rolandweber/pityoulish/</a>.
Just open an issue and share your experience.
</p>

If you want to modify an exercise or add your own, fork the project.
You're welcome to contribute improvements or additions back upstream,
but you're not required to. The project sources are in the public domain.
