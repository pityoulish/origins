  <span>Classroom Setup</span>
</h1>
<p class="abstract">
All Pityoulish classroom exercises share a common setup:
students connect to the instructor's server;
server output appears on a public screen.
Below are instructions to establish this setup
and to run an exercise, including preparation and debriefing.
</p>

<div class="larger">

The first two sections are about technical aspects,
the other two about organization.

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="procure"><span>What You Need</span></h2><!-- Ingredients -->

<dl>
<dt>Server Machine</dt>
<dd>
Even a Netbook will have sufficient computing power and memory
for running the server software. The machine needs video output,
so that you can connect it to a projector or other public display.
Check which connector (HDMI, VGA), cables, or adapters you need.
</dd>

<dt>Server Runtime</dt>
<dd>
As of 2016, the required server runtime is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
or better a Java Development Kit (JDK). Future enhancements might add
components for Node.js, Python, or other runtimes.
If your server machine is an x86 architecture running Linux, Windows,
or MacOS, these runtimes are readily available.
If you're on another architecture, for example a Raspberry Pi,
better double-check the availability of the runtimes you require.
</dd>

<dt>Network</dt>
<dd>
A wireless access point, without Internet connection,
should be enough to serve a dozen groups of students or more.&sup1;
When working in groups, students can still do online research from a
different machine than the one connected to the exercise network.
If they wanted to cheat by accessing the Pityoulish source code,
you couldn't stop them anyway.
<br/>
If you prefer to use an on-site network in the classroom,
either wired or wireless, verify that there are no firewalls
that would prevent the student machines from connecting to your server,
or to eachother.
<p>&sup1;)
<i>In 2016, the corporate laptop of one student acted up though,
complaining about "limited availability" of the network.</i>
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Web Server</dt>
<dd>
The Pityoulish exercises are packaged for presentation on a web server.
If the exercise network has no Internet connection, you should run a
web server on the server machine. Otherwise, you can upload the material
on any public web server.
The content students need to access are the exercises themselves,
and required documentation such as the standard JavaDocs.
The exercises can also be downloaded as a zip file and extracted locally,
for browsing with a <code>file:</code> URL.
</dd>

<dt>Client Machine</dt>
<dd>
A dedicated client machine is required only for the rehearsal,
but you MUST rehearse. Some network related problems, like a wrong hostname
or IP address in an RMI stub, will only occur if you run the client code
on a different machine than the server component.
</dd>
</dl>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="rehearse"><span>Rehearse</span></h2>

<p>
Tech Rehearsal to avoid pitfalls.
<a href="https://notalwaysworking.com/all-the-worlds-a-rage/30673"
   >Anecdote</a>.
There's also a Content Rehearsal for each exercise, see there.
</p>

<ul class="todo">
<li>
Connect server to network. Look up IP address or hostname.
</li>
<li>
Start web server.
Connect client to network.
Access web server from client: Exercise, related documentation.
Use IP address or hostname in URL? http or https?
</li>
<li>
Start exercise-specific server in terminal.
Fixed port or random port?
Access server from other machine.
Use IP address or hostname? Firewall in the way?
</li>
<li>
Connect server to projector or other shared display.
Do you get a picture?
Need to adjust graphic adapter settings?
Mirror display or extend desktop?
</li>
<li>
Move terminal to shared display.
Adjust window size, 80 columns or more recommended.
Output readable from the back row?
Adjust font size and colors.
</li>
<li>
Where will you put auxiliary for the students?
Whiteboard, blackboard, flipchart that is not blocked by the projection screen?
An extra window on the projected screen?
Can't use the server terminal, that will scroll off.
</li>
</ul>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="schedule"><span>Schedule</span></h2>

<p>
Big scale: Term.
</p>

<ul class="todo">
<li>
Do the students need to prepare?
Hand out a Tutorial, reading list or preparation exercise well in advance,
one or two weeks.
</li>
<li>
You need to prepare even better than the students,
so you can help them when they run into problems.
Do not underestimate this!
</li>
<li>
What topics are you going to teach in advance?
What are you going to teach immediately before and after the exercise?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Small scale: Lesson.
</p>

<ul class="todo">
<li>
How much time for programming in-class? 60 minutes, 45 minutes?
</li>
<li>
How much time for discussions afterwards?
Make sure you have room to spare if things go wrong.
Make sure you have other material prepared, if things go smoothly.
</li>
<li>
How to form groups of 2 to 3 students? Neighbors, random, other?
How much time to form groups?
</li>
</ul>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="evaluate"><span>Lessons Learned</span></h2>

<ul class="todo">
<li>
Gather feedback from the students immediately after the exercise,
and again a few weeks later in hindsight.
</li>
<li>
Found out something you want to write down for the next time?
</li>
<li>
Found out something that might be useful to others?
Please share upstream.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please provide feedback, positive and negative, to the Open Source project at
<a href="https://github.com/rolandweber/pityoulish/"
   >https://github.com/rolandweber/pityoulish/</a>.
Just open an issue and share your experience.

If you want to modify an exercise or add your own, fork the project.
You're welcome to contribute improvements or additions back upstream,
but you're not required to. The project sources are in the public domain.
