<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="upfront"><span>What You Need</span></h2><!-- Ingredients -->

<ul class="todo">
<li>
Server. Any Netbook will have sufficient performance.
You'll need a server runtime though (JVM, Node.js, Python,...).
If you're not on x86 (Linux or Windows), better double-check availability.
Video output (HDMI, VGA?) to connect to projector or other shared display.
</li>
<li>
Network. Wireless access point without Internet connection will do.
Might even be better than having an Internet connection:
less distraction, no access to Pityoulish sources.
</li>
<li>
Software. Local web server with exercise and related documentation;
optional if Internet connection is available.
Server software with suitable runtime, depending on the exercise.
</li>
<li>
Client. Different machine!
<i>Only for the rehearsal, but you MUST rehearse.</i>
</li>
</ul>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="rehearse"><span>Rehearse</span></h2>

<p>
Tech Rehearsal.
There's also a Content Rehearsal, but that depends on the exercise.

<ul class="todo">
<li>
Connect server to network. Look up IP address or hostname.

Access web server from client: Exercise, related documentation.
Use IP address or hostname in URL? http or https?
</li>
<li>
Start exercise-specific server in terminal.
Fixed port or random port?
Access server from other machine.
Use IP address or hostname? Firewall in the way?
</li>

<li>
Move terminal to shared display.
Adjust window size, 80 columns or more recommended.
Output readable from the back row?

</li>
<li>
Where will you put auxiliary for the students?
Whiteboard, blackboard, flipchart that is not blocked by the projection screen?
An extra window on the projected screen?
Can't use the server terminal, that will scroll off.
</li>
</ul>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="schedule"><span>Schedule</span></h2>

<ul class="todo">
<li>
Do the students need to prepare?
Hand out a Tutorial, reading list or preparation exercise well in advance,
one or two weeks.
</li>
<li>
You need to prepare even better than the students,
so you can help them when they run into problems.
Do not underestimate this!
</li>
<li>
How much time for programming in-class? 60 minutes, 45 minutes?
</li>
<li>
How much time for discussions afterwards?
Make sure you have room to spare if things go wrong.
Make sure you have other material prepared, if things go smoothly.
</li>
<li>
How to form groups of 2 to 3 students? Neighbors, random, other?
How much time to form groups?
