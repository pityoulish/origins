  <span>Tutorial: Prepare for Java Exercises</span>
</h1>
<p class="abstract">
In this tutorial, you will practice the development procedures
needed for the upcoming Java classroom exercises.
Use your preferred IDE or command-line environment to fix the planted bugs.
</p>

<div class="larger">
<p>
In the upcoming classroom exercises, you will have to fix intentional bugs
in a client program. The objective of this tutorial is to familiarize you
with the development procedures and to establish a minimal routine.
During the classroom exercises, you should be able to focus on the code and
the bugs, rather than figure out how to compile sources and build a JAR.
The most common pitfall though is to get lost in the details of
an unfamiliar codebase, and distracted from the implementation target.
One tutorial is not enough to protect against that, but I'll do what I can.
</p>
<p>
The Tutorial is organized into the following sections:
<ol>
<li>
  <a href="#prereqs">Prerequisites</a>
  -
  Install the required tools, and desired ones as well
</li>
<li>
  <a href="#setup">Setup</a>
  -
  Create a project and build a JAR
</li>
<li>
  <a href="#exercise">Tutorial Exercise</a>
  -
  Find and fix the planted bugs
</li>
<li>
  <a href="#code">Code Overview</a>
  -
  Navigate the code, from JavaDocs to source code
</li>
<li>
  <a href="#links">Links</a>
  -
  Downloads, further reading, feedback
</li>
</ol>
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
If you're an experienced Java developer,
the development procedures will already be familiar to you.
But many students in my classes are not. This tutorial establishes a baseline
of required tools and skills for the classroom exercises.
</p>

<p>
To work through the exercises from the command line, you need a web browser,
a text editor, and a Java Development Kit (JDK).
If available for your platform, you can use the OpenJDK.
Beware of the Oracle Java installers for Windows and OS X, they have a
reputation for installing adware along with the Java browser plug-in,
which you don't need.
</p>
<p>
Execute the following commands to verify that a JDK is available:
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>java -version</span></div>
  <div class="input"><span>javac -version</span></div>
</div>

<p>
If you prefer to code with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE),
there are several that support Java development.
<br>
For example
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/"
   title="IntelliJ IDEA - Community Edition"
   >IntelliJ</a>,
<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/"
   title="Eclipse IDE for Java Developers"
   >Eclipse</a>,
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java"
   title="Visual Studio Code"
   >Visual Studio Code</a>, or
<a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html"
   title="NetBeans - Java SE"
   >NetBeans</a>.
</p>


<p>
For convenience, bookmark the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/"
   >Java SE API</a> documentation of the Java version you are using.
<br>
When working from the command line, collect frequently used commands
in a text file for copy&amp;paste.
</p>



<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="setup">
  <span>Setup</span>
  <a href="#setup" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h2>

<div class="box-right">
<dl>
<dt><a href="tutorial-faulty.jar"><code>tutorial-faulty.jar</code></a></dt>
<dd>The program to test and fix. Usage instructions:
  <div><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;java -jar tutorial-faulty.jar</code></div>
  Sources are in the JAR,
  <a href="jdoc/index.html" target="_blank">docs</a> here.
</dd>
</dl>
</div><!-- box-right -->

<p>
Download the file
<a href="tutorial-faulty.jar"><code>tutorial-faulty.jar</code></a>
and save it with a decent filename. In the remainder of this Tutorial,
the name <code>tutorial.jar</code> is assumed.
While the JAR is faulty now, it won't be when you're done with it.
Using a filename without negative connotations supports
a positive mindset right from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
Run the program to verify the download.
It is an executable JAR file, so you don't have to specify a class name.
This should print usage instructions, which you will need later on:
</p>

<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>java -jar tutorial.jar</span></div>
</div>

<p>
If you're not familiar with JAR files, have a look at the content now.
They are similar to zip archives, with some extra conventions for storing
and executing Java classes. If you need more guidance, read the
<a href="tpj-details.html#jar">detailed description</a>
of the JAR file content.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to prepare for changing the code
and building your own version of the JAR file.
<br>
How to do that depends on the IDE you are using, if any.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, verify that the program is using
the correct character encoding for input and output.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="setup-cmdline">
  <span>Command Line</span>
  <a href="#setup-cmdline" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>
Create a new directory to work in, for example <code>tutorial-project/</code>.
Make sure that the name of your directory does <i>not</i> contain "faulty".
<br>
Use <code>cd</code> to change there.
All command-line examples assume that this is your current directory.
</p>

<p>
Extract the contents of the downloaded JAR file:
</p>

<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>jar -xvf /path/to/tutorial.jar</span></div>
</div>

<p>
Subdirectory <code>pityoulish/</code> contains the
source code, properties files, and compiled classes.
<br>
Subdirectory <code>META-INF/</code> can be ignored or deleted.
</p>

<p>
After changing a Java source file, you have to recompile it.
<br>
For example, after editing
<code>pityoulish/tutorial/TutorialCommandHandler.java</code>,
compile it with:
</p>

<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>javac pityoulish/tutorial/TutorialCommandHandler.java</span></div>
</div>

<p>
Build a new JAR from your working directory:
</p>

<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>jar -cfe tutorial.jar pityoulish.tutorial.Main pityoulish/</span></div>
</div>

<p>
Run your own JAR and verify that it prints the expected usage information.
If it doesn't, read the
<a href="tpj-details.html#jar-trouble">troubleshooting tips</a>.
</p>

<p>
You will have to compile a source file and build a new JAR several times.
Either use the command line history to access previously executed commands,
or prepare commands for copy&amp;paste in an editor.
</p>

<p class="abstract">
How to perform the steps in this section depends on the IDE you have chosen.
<br>
You're welcome to contribute specific instructions
for other users of your IDE.
<br>
Available online:
<a href="https://github.com/pityoulish/origins/issues/71"

</p>

<!-- ............................................................ -->
<div class="side-note"><div class="content">
<span>Editing</span>
</div></div>

<p>
Create a Java or JAR project.
Make sure that the name of your project does <i>not</i> contain "faulty".
<br>
Import the downloaded JAR into the project.
</p>

<p>
The IDE has created a directory structure for the project
and stored the source code there.
<br>
Locate that directory, then use the <a href="#setup-cmdline">command line</a>
for compiling sources and building the JAR.
<br>
Edit the sources and navigate with your IDE,
but switch to the command line for testing.
</p>

<p>
In theory, an IDE can run your code as well as build the JAR.
In practice, many students have wasted countless hours,
at home and in the classroom, while trying to get this to work.
Spare yourself a lot of trouble and frustration: Use the IDE only for editing.
</p>

<!-- ............................................................ -->
<div class="side-note" style="margin-top: 2em;"><div class="content">
<span>Testing</span>
</div></div>

<p>
If you insist on running the code from your IDE, you must set up the classpath.
The IDE automatically puts compiled classes into the classpath.
But you have to add the source directory as well, so that the running code
can load the properties files from there.
Alternatively, it might be possible to let the IDE copy all properties files
from the source directory to the compiled classes.
</p>

<p>
The entry point for the Tutorial code is class
<code>pityoulish.tutorial.Main</code>.
<br>
Run the program without arguments and verify that it prints usage information.
If it doesn't, fix the classpath.
</p>

<p>
For testing the code, you have to specify command-line arguments.
An IDE typically provides a dialog for that purpose.
</p>

<p>
The final results of this Tutorial and the exercises
should be an executable JAR file.
The JAR has to include the properties files from the source code
along with the compiled classes.
The entry point of the program must be defined in the manifest of the JAR.
An IDE will provide one or more dialogs for these settings.
</p>

<p>
Run your own JAR without arguments and verify that it prints
usage information. If it doesn't, read the
<a href="tpj-details.html#jar-trouble">troubleshooting tips</a>.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="setup-charset">
  <span>Character Encoding</span>
  <a href="#setup-charset" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>
Call the <code>latin</code> command of the JAR.
It will print a message that contains umlauts.
Check whether these are displayed correctly.
<br>
If not, the Java interpreter uses the wrong character encoding for output.
</p>

<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>java -jar tutorial.jar latin</span></div>
</div>

<p>
Pass additional arguments to the <code>latin</code> command.
Use words that contain special characters, like umlauts
or the Euro symbol &euro;.
<br>
If the default message is displayed correctly, but your arguments are not,
the Java interpreter uses the wrong character encoding for input.
</p>

<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>java -jar tutorial.jar latin Wörter &euro;uro</span></div>
</div>

<p>
If characters are not displayed correctly, read the
<a href="tpj-details.html#encoding-trouble">troubleshooting tips</a>.

  <span>Tutorial Exercise</span>
  <a href="#exercise" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>
The main loop of an exercise is to manually execute a test sequence
and to overcome the problems you encounter.
Some problems will be your own mistakes, like passing wrong arguments
to a command or connecting to the wrong network.
Some problems are intentional bugs in the code, which you have to fix.
</p>

<p>
The information here is specific to this Tutorial.
A general description for the exercises is in
<a href="test-fix-repeat.html">Test and Fix</a>.
</p>



<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="test-sequence">
  <span>Test</span>
  <a href="#test-sequence" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>
The commands supported by the tutorial program are independent of eachother.
You could test them in any order.
<br>
The usage instructions suggest this sequence:
</p>

<ol>
<li><code>local</code></li>
<li><code>islocal</code></li>
<li><code>lookup</code></li>
</ol>

<p>
There are two problems to find and fix.
<br>
The command <code>latin</code> is not part of the exercise.
It is provided only for the setup in section
<a href="#setup-charset">Character Encoding</a> above.
</p>

<p>
Read the usage instructions for each command and try it out.
If you encounter a <code>pityoulish.outtake.Missing</code> exception,
you found one of the planted bugs.
All other problems originate from your environment or input.
Solve those without changing code.
</p>

<p>
If you'd like more guidance, read the suggestions for testing
<a href="tpj-details.html#test-local"><code>local</code></a>,
<a href="tpj-details.html#test-islocal"><code>islocal</code></a>, and
<a href="tpj-details.html#test-lookup"><code>lookup</code></a>.
</p>

</h3>

<p>
The stack traces lead you directly to the bugs in the code.
<br>
<b>But</b> you are not familiar with the codebase yet.
<br>
Before you even look at the source code,
get an <a href="#code">overview</a>.
</p>

<p>
Once you have an overview, follow a stack trace
to the point where some code is missing.
</p>
<ul>
<li>In which part of the codebase are you?</li>
<li>What is supposed to happen at this point?</li>
<li>What data is available here?</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you'd like more guidance, there are descriptions for
interpreting <a href="java-refresher.html#stack-trace">stack traces</a>
and for <a href="java-refresher.html#available-data">available data</a>
at a point in the code.
</p>



<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="fix">
  <span>Fix</span>
  <a href="#fix" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>
Read the exception message, and the comments in the code.
What is it you have to do?
Initialize an attribute? Assign a variable? Modify a data structure?
Return a value? Call a method? A combination of these?
<a href="#think">Think!</a>
</p>

<p>
Is there another method that does something similar?
Go there, see how it's done, and copy shamelessly.
<i>Sorry, not in this Tutorial. But in some exercises.</i>
</p>

<p>
Remove the calls to class <code>Missing</code> at the point of the problem.
Put in your code snippet instead.
Remove comments that no longer apply.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes you can make the code prettier by combining your snippet
with commands before or after.
<i>Not in this Tutorial. And it's not necessary in the exercises.</i>
</p>

<p>
If you cannot figure out how to fix the prepared problems, there is help
for <a href="tpj-details.html#help-islocal"><code>islocal</code></a>
and <a href="tpj-details.html#help-lookup"><code>lookup</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
Save your changes and compile the file.
IDEs often do that automatically.
When working with the command line, use <code>javac</code>
as explained <a href="#setup-cmdline" title="Setup: Command Line">above</a>.
Fix compiler errors.
</p>

<p>
Create a new JAR and repeat your tests. If the bug is fixed, continue
with testing until you've found and eliminated all intentional bugs.
</p>



<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="clean-up">
  <span>Clean Up</span>
  <a href="#clean-up" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>
Once you've fixed the prepared problems, class <code>Missing</code>
is no longer needed.
It was just an artifice to lead you to the planted bugs.
That's why it was left out of the generated
<a href="jdoc/index.html" target="_blank">JavaDocs</a>.
</p>

<p>
Delete the directory <code>pityoulish/outtake/</code> from your project,
both source code and compiled class.
Then recompile all remaining classes and fix compiler errors.
This will detect unused imports of class <code>Missing</code>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, create a new JAR.

</h3>

<p>
JavaDocs show APIs and explain their purpose, usage, and important concepts.
They hide the code, which is advantageous for getting an overview.
When the description of a package tells you that it isn't relevant for
the task at hand, don't waste time looking into the package.
Likewise for interfaces, classes, and enums.
More often than not, knowing what they are about is enough.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Understand the purpose of the packages, imagine how they work together.
Then pick the package most relevant to your task.
</li>
<li>
Looking into a package, locate the most important interfaces and classes.
Separate the external API of the package from internal classes.
The API is more important than implementation details.
</li>
<li>
Understand the purpose of the API interfaces and classes.
Imagine how they work together with the internal classes to implement the API.
</li>
<li>
This is how you get an overview.
Details follow later.
Once you have an overview, details will click into place.

<div class="box-center">
<span class="header">
<span class="title">Word of Advice</span>
<span class="abstract"
      >Badly structured code obstructs understanding.</span>
</span><!-- header -->
<span class="content">
When you are diving into any codebase of significant size, it is
impossible to understand every part of it to the very last detail.
In order to find the code of interest within a reasonable time,
you absolutely <span class="emph">must</span> make assumptions
about other parts of the code.

In a well-structured codebase, classes and modules behave roughly as
you would expect from their names or descriptions. This is called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment"
   >Principle of Least Astonishment (POLA)</a>.
It greatly simplifies the task of getting to know a codebase
and reduces the time you need to become productive.
<br>

In ill-structured code, such assumptions will not hold.
Classes or modules do things you wouldn't expect, and
things you do expect are not done where you expect them.
You'll spend a lot of time searching for why something is happening,
until you find the cause hidden away in an inconspicuous module.
Or you'll read through some code and see that it is doing
completely unrelated things as well.
These moments of realization are called WTFs. In fact,
<a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m">WTFs per minute</a>
are a measurement of code quality.
For a regular stream of bad examples, see
<a class="covert" href="http://thedailywtf.com/">The Daily WTF</a>.
</span>
</div>

<p>
IDEs, like JavaDocs, show lists of packages, classes, and methods.
But they are designed to take you <i>into</i> the code, not to get an overview.
When using an IDE, you're more likely to look at implementation details
instead of thinking about modules, responsibilities, and concepts.
It gets even worse if you step through the code with a source-level debugger.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="code-sources">
  <span>Source Code</span>
  <a href="#code-sources" class="here-link">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>
Sooner or later, you have to look at the source code to fix problems.
A stack trace can take you right to the problem.
When looking around at that point, remember the overview
and avoid studying incidental code.
Look at JavaDocs to learn what a method does, not at the source code.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, it is necessary to understand the program flow.
You might start at the main entry point, which is
specified in the JAR manifest for all exercises.
You can also look at a stack trace, which tells you
how the program got to the point of a problem.
Again, remember the overview and avoid studying incidental code.
