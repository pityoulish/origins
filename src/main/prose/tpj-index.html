  <span>Tutorial: Prepare for Java Exercises</span>
</h1>
<p class="abstract">
After completing this tutorial, you are familiar with the structure of the
upcoming Java classroom exercises. You know how to perform the required
development procedures in your preferred development environment.
</p>

<div class="larger">
This tutorial comprises three phases:
<dl>
  <dt>1. <a href="#run-jar">Run the JAR</a></dt>
  <dd>
    You execute the provided, runnable JAR to understand
    what it is supposed to do, and what is wrong with it.
  </dd>

  <dt>2. <a href="#study-source">Study the Sources</a></dt>
  <dd>
    You look at the provided JavaDocs and source files
    to find your way through the code.
  </dd>

  <dt>3. <a href="#fix-problems">Fix the Problems</a></dt>
  <dd>
    You fix the source code and build your own, working JAR from it.
  </dd>
</dl>

The <a href="#recipe">recipe</a> outlines the steps to follow
when working on a Java classroom exercise.
You practice most of these steps in the tutorial.

Last but not least, there is some information about the
<a href="#msgboard">upcoming</a> exercises.
Reading it before the first classroom exercise gives you a head start.
</div>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="run-jar"><span>Run the JAR</span></h2>

<div class="box-right">
<dl>
<dt><a href="tutorial-faulty.jar"><code>tutorial-faulty.jar</code></a></dt>
<dd>The program to test and fix. Usage instructions:
  <br/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;java -jar tutorial-faulty.jar</code><br/>
  Sources are in the jar, <a href="jdoc/index.html">docs</a> here.
</dd>
</dl>
</div><!-- box-right -->

<p>
First verify that a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or
Java Development Kit (JDK) is available on your computer.
Open a command line and enter:
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>java -version</span></div>
</div>
<p>
Version 1.7 or later is needed. If the <code>java</code> command is not found,
you have to investigate why. Most likely it is just missing from the
search path. Locate an installed JVM or JDK and add its <code>bin</code>
directory to the <code>PATH</code> environment variable,
or use the full path to run <code>java</code> and related utilities.
If there is neither JVM nor JDK, install a JDK. You'll need it later anyway.
How to do that depends on your operating system and the JDK you want to use.
<!-- @@@ TODO: warn about the adware installed by Oracle on Windows? -->
<!-- @@@ TODO: Extra page with instructions for installing a JDK? -->
</p>

<p>
Now download the file
<a href="tutorial-faulty.jar"><code>tutorial-faulty.jar</code></a>
to your machine. Change to the directory where you saved it and enter:
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>java -jar tutorial-faulty.jar</span></div>
</div>
<p>
This tells <code>java</code> to run the program contained in the JAR file.
Without further arguments, that program just prints usage instructions.
Take a minute to read those.
</p>
<p>
Seriously, read them. <!-- Now! -->
</p>

<p>
So, the program understands several different commands.
Use <code>latin</code> to check whether your environment is ready
to display characters from the ISO Latin 1 character set.
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>java -jar tutorial-faulty.jar latin</span></div>
</div>
<p>
If the output contains umlauts, you're all set. If it contains garbage, or
question marks in unexpected places, you need to do something. The default
character encoding of the JVM does not match that of your command line.
This is a common problem with <code>cmd.exe</code> on Windows.
You can use a different command line, for example the PowerShell,
or figure out how to
<a href="http://illegalargumentexception.blogspot.co.uk/2009/04/i18n-unicode-at-windows-command-prompt.html"
   >fix the problem</a>.
</p>

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="test-commands"><span>Test the Commands</span></h3>

<p>
The downloaded JAR supports three more commands besides <code>latin</code>.
They cover the technical content of this tutorial: IP addresses and hostnames.
Let's try them one after another, starting with <code>local</code>.
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>java -jar tutorial-faulty.jar local</span></div>
  <div class="output"
>Network Interface 'wlan0'
   fe80:0:0:0:fc5a:73ee:fe85:733c%3
   10.223.123.161
Network Interface 'lo'
   0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1%1   ip6-localhost
   127.0.0.1   localhost</div>
</div>
<p>
The output depends on the network configuration and available connections.
In the example, the machine is connected to a WLAN, 'wlan0'.
The local interface, 'lo', is always present. It enables programs
that run on the same machine to communicate with eachother, even if
there is no actual network connection. The machine from the example
has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address on either network interface.
Does yours?
</p>

<p>
The remaining two commands expect an argument, which can be a hostname or
an IP address. The usage instructions only mention hostnames, but all
operating systems are smart enough to handle IP addresses as well.
Let's try both commands with 'localhost' as the argument.
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>java -jar tutorial-faulty.jar islocal localhost</span></div>
  <div class="output"
>Exception in thread "main" <span class="emph">pityoulish.outtake.Missing</span>: bind a socket to a hostname
	at ...</div>
  <div class="input"><span>java -jar tutorial-faulty.jar lookup localhost</span></div>
  <div class="output"
>Looking up 'localhost'...
Exception in thread "main" <span class="emph">pityoulish.outtake.Missing</span>: look up the InetAddress(es) of a hostname
	at ...</div>
</div>

<p>
Dang! Both commands are broken. Well, there had to be a reason why the JAR
is called 'faulty'. The class of the exception,
<code>pityoulish.outtake.Missing</code>, indicates that something was
intentionally left out of the program. And you are expected to fill it in.
If you see a different exception, there is a problem.
Read the exception message. At best, it's just a typo in the command line.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="study-source"><span>Study the Sources</span></h2>

<p>
Before you proceed, rename the downloaded JAR to <code>tutorial.jar</code>
or some other name without negative connotation.
While it is faulty now, it won't be when you're done with it.
Renaming the file supports a positive mindset right from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
List the contents of the JAR file.
Use the <code title="jar -tf">jar</code> utility of a JDK,
or <code title="unzip -l">unzip</code>,
or any other archive utility that is compatible with the zip format.
The example output below shows only a subset of the files.
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>jar -tf tutorial.jar</span></div>
  <div class="output"
>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
pityoulish/cmdline/ArgsInterpreter.java
...
pityoulish/outtake/<span class="emph">Missing.java</span>
pityoulish/outtake/package.html
pityoulish/tutorial/Main.java
pityoulish/tutorial/TutorialCommandHandler.java
pityoulish/cmdline/ArgsInterpreter.class
...
pityoulish/outtake/<span class="emph">Missing.class</span>
pityoulish/tutorial/Main.class
...
pityoulish/tutorial/TutorialCommandHandler.class
</div>
</div>
<p>
On first glance, it seems as if classes are listed twice. Indeed,
a closer look reveals that the JAR contains source code (.java)
along with compiled classes (.class). The presence of 'package.html' files
suggests that there might even be meaningful JavaDocs.
It is always possible to generate JavaDocs from source code.
But if the source code doesn't contain special JavaDoc comments,
the generated docs are not necessarily useful. Alas, the mere presence of
JavaDoc comments also doesn't ensure that they contain anything useful.
Fortunately, this is a tutorial with well-documented source code.
</p>

<p>
If you plan to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding,
now is a good time to import <code>tutorial.jar</code> as a new project.
There are many IDEs that support Java development, for example
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/"
   title="IntelliJ IDEA - Community Edition"
   >IntelliJ</a>,
<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/"
   title="Eclipse IDE for Java Developers"
   >Eclipse</a>,
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"
   title="Visual Studio Code"
   >Visual Studio Code</a>, or
<a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html"
   title="NetBeans - Java SE"
   >NetBeans</a>.

However, you don't need an IDE to complete this tutorial,
or the upcoming programming exercises.
Just use the archiver from above to extract the files from the JAR, and your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war" class="covert"
   >favorite editor</a>
to browse them.
Make sure to maintain the directory structure when extracting though.
</p>
<!-- doesn't add much value and looks crappy above the h3

</div>
-->


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="jdoc-walk-through"><span>JavaDoc Walk-Through</span></h3>

<p>
Before you dive into the source code and get lost in its intricacies,
you should get a high-level overview. Modern IDEs make it very easy to
access context-specific information. For example, they can show the JavaDocs
for a method as hover help, right there where the method is being called.
At the same time, they beguile users into neglecting the bigger context.
Why bother with the class- or package-level JavaDocs when the method-level
is readily available? Never mind that the former might point out
other classes or methods that would serve your purposes better, or
provide valuable information that applies to all the methods of a class.
To avoid this pitfall, don't go into your IDE or editor just yet.
</p>

<p>
Open the <a href="jdoc/index.html">JavaDocs</a> in a new browser tab or window,
so you can easily switch between them and this description.
Check the list of packages. There are only two,
<code>pityoulish.cmdline</code> and <code>pityoulish.tutorial</code>.
In the main content frame, click on the first one. Now you see a list of
interfaces and classes in that package. Glimpse at the names. They are
about commands, handling, and arguments. The package description begins
with "Utility classes". This indicates that the package does not contain
the main functionality of the program, but supporting features.
Are you interested in learning how the command-line arguments are interpreted?
If so, write it down on your to-do list for later.
Right now, the support functionality is not your concern.
</p>

<p>
Next, access the JavaDocs for the <code>pityoulish.tutorial</code> package.
There is a class <code>Main</code>, described as the main entry point.
Now you know where to start. There is an enum with four constants,
named like the four commands which <code>tutorial.jar</code> understands.
And there is a handler class with methods named like the four commands.
Could <code>handleLatinCmd</code> be the method which prints the umlauts
for the 'latin' command? Yes, the description says so.
Without even looking at the source code, you've learned where the
important things are happening.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="source-walk-through"><span>Source Code Walk-Through</span></h3>

<p>
Now it is time to browse the source code. If you didn't know already
from the JavaDocs where to start, you would have to look into the file
<code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code>. It defines a property 'Main-Class',
which tells <code>java -jar</code> about the entry point of the program.
Unsurprisingly, the value is <code>pityoulish.tutorial.Main</code>.
Open the source file for that class in your IDE or editor
and find the method <code>main</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>main</code> method initializes an arg(ument)s interpreter,
calls it with the command-line arguments, and is done.
If you hadn't looked at the JavaDocs first, you would now probably
follow the program execution and look into the args interpreter.
However, you already know that it comes from a utility package, and that
the commands are implemented in <code>TutorialCommandHandler</code>.
An instance of that class is given to the args interpreter as a
constructor argument. The other constructor argument is some kind of 'None',
so probably not relevant here. The natural conclusion is that
the args interpreter will call the command handler.
Let's go directly to the latter, without wasting time on the former.
</p>

<p>
Looking at <code>TutorialCommandHandler</code>, you see the enumeration of
supported commands, a method that returns usage instructions, and a method
with a <code>switch</code> statement on the enum. Each case of that statement
calls a handler method for the respective command.
Whatever else the args interpreter does, it calls here to execute a command.
That's all you need to know about it to get started.
</p>


<div class="box-center">
<span class="header">
<span class="title">Word of Advice</span>
<span class="abstract"
      >Badly structured code invalidates natural conclusions.</span>
</span><!-- header -->
<span class="content">
When you are diving into any codebase of significant size, it is
impossible to understand every part of it to the very last detail.
In order to find the code of interest within a reasonable time,
you absolutely <span class="emph">must</span> make assumptions
about other parts of the code.

In a well-structured codebase, classes and modules behave roughly as
you would expect from their names or descriptions. This is called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment"
   >Principle of Least Astonishment (POLA)</a>.
It greatly simplifies the task of getting to know a codebase
and reduces the time you need to become productive.
<br/>

In ill-structured code, such assumptions will not hold.
Classes or modules do things you wouldn't expect, and
things you do expect are not done where you expect them.
You'll spend a lot of time searching for why something is happening,
until you find the cause hidden away in an inconspicuous module.
Or you'll read through some code and see that it is doing
completely unrelated things as well.
These moments of realization are called WTFs. In fact,
<a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m">WTFs per minute</a>
are a measurement of code quality.

<h2 id="fix-problems"><span>Fix the Problems</span></h2>

<p>
There are two broken commands to fix in this tutorial.
The following instructions for the <a href="#fix-islocal">first</a>
are very detailed.
Those for the <a href="#fix-lookup">second</a> remain brief,
so you can apply what you learned.
Finally, you should <a href="#clean-up">clean up</a>.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="fix-islocal"><span>Fix the <code>islocal</code> Command</span></h3>

<p>
Call the command again, to have a closer look at the error message
and the stack trace. Details such as line numbers probably differ
from the example output. Work with what you see in your command-line terminal,
because that matches with the source code in your JAR.
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"><span>java -jar tutorial.jar islocal localhost</span></div>
  <div class="output"
>Exception in thread "main" pityoulish.outtake.Missing: <span class="emph">bind a socket to a hostname</span>

	at pityoulish.cmdline.ArgsInterpreter.handle(ArgsInterpreter.java:88)
	at pityoulish.tutorial.Main.main(Main.java:27)
</div>
</div>


<!-- ............................................................ -->
<div class="side-note"><div class="content">
<span>Interpret the Stack Trace</span>
</div></div>

<p>
The first line reveals the class of the exception and the exception message.
The class often indicates the type of problem, for example
a <code>NullPointerException</code> or an <code>IOException</code>.
In this case, some code is missing; you already know that.
The message tells you what the missing code is supposed to do.
We'll get to that later, once you've found the place where it is missing.
</p>
<p>
The lines starting with "at" are the call stack.
The program execution started at <code>main</code>, which is in the last line.
<code>main</code> called <code>ArgsInterpreter.handle</code>,
which called <code>CommandHandlerBase.handle</code>,
which called something else, and so on,
right up to <code>Missing.here</code> at the top of the stack.
And there, the exception was thrown. In parenthesis, you see
the source file name 'Missing.java' and a line number.
Open the file and find the line number indicated by your stack trace.
If you executed the command from within an IDE,
you probably just have to click a link in the output.
Now what is wrong in <code>here</code>?
</p>

<p>
Well, nothing is wrong in <code>Missing.here</code>.
It is a helper method meant to throw an exception, and so it does.
The caller must have found that something is wrong
and raised an exception by invoking the helper.
You need to find the place from which it is being called.
Luckily, the second line of the stack trace tells you exactly that.
Load the file 'TutorialCommandHandler.java' and
have a look at method <code>handleIsLocalCmd</code>,
especially around the line number from your stack trace.
There you'll see the following statements:
</p>
<div class="code">
  Missing.here("bind a socket to a hostname");
  Missing.pretend(IOException.class);
</div>


<!-- ............................................................ -->
<div class="side-note"><div class="content">
<span>Analyze the Problem</span>
</div></div>

<p>
Before you can fix anything, you have to understand what is going on
in that part of the code. The references to class <code>Missing</code>
are exactly where you'll have to put in your own code. The message,
'bind a socket to a hostname', tells you what is missing.
But unless you are familiar with the socket API, this message is unclear.
The call to <code>Missing.pretend</code> indicates that the missing code
may throw an <code>IOException</code>.
</p>

<p>
When a method is so small as <code>handleIsLocalCmd</code>, you should try
to understand it fully. There is a description, which you can read in the
source code as well as in the <a href="jdoc/index.html">JavaDocs</a>.
The method is expected to return 0 if the argument is the local host,
or -1 if it is not. In the method body, there is some error handling code.
If the missing code runs through, the method returns 0.
If it throws an <code>IOException</code>, the method returns -1.
Before that, the string argument is converted into an
<code>InetSocketAddress</code>.
Let's summarize:
</p>
<ol>
<li>You have a hostname,
  already converted to <code>InetSocketAddress</code>.</li>
<li>The missing code should run through if the hostname is local.</li>
<li>The missing code should throw an <code>IOException</code>
  if the hostname is not local.</li>
<li>The missing code should 'bind' a 'socket' to the hostname.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Now it is time to study the standard Java APIs. There are JavaDocs available:
online, for download, or maybe already installed with your JDK or IDE.
Pick whichever is most convenient for you.
The <code>InetSocketAddress</code> is a place to start. Look for the
import statements at the beginning of 'TutorialCommandHandler.java'.
From which package is that class?
What other classes are imported from there?
Anything related to 'bind' or 'socket'?
Bingo, there's an import of <code>java.net.Socket</code>.
<a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=javadoc+InetSocketAddress+java.net.Socket"
   class="covert"
   >Search</a> and browse the JavaDocs for these two classes.
Is there something about 'bind'?
Can you do that with an <code>InetSocketAddress</code>?
Does it make a difference whether the hostname is local?
</p>

<p>
When you have found and assimilated that information, put in the missing code.
Delete the calls to class <code>Missing</code>.
Create an unconnected socket. Bind that socket to the hostname.
That's it. <span class="emph">Maybe</span>.
To be sure, you need to test your changes.
</p>


<!-- ............................................................ -->
<div class="side-note"><div class="content">
<span>Build the JAR</span>
</div></div>

<p>
If you are using an IDE, it compiles modified source files automatically.
IDEs also provide an option to export your project as a JAR file. But
you have to check whether that JAR file can be run with <code>java -jar</code>.
If not, look for options to specify the property 'Main-Class' of the manifest.
If all else fails, you can still run your code by spelling out the classname.
It's less convenient, but works just as well.
These two commands are equivalent, both print the usage instructions:
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"
       ><span>java -jar tutorial.jar</span></div>
  <div class="input"
       ><span>java -cp tutorial.jar pityoulish.tutorial.Main</span></div>
</div>

<p>
Without an IDE, you have to call the compiler and build the JAR explicitly.
Assuming that the current directory is where you extracted the JAR,
use the following commands:
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"
       ><span>javac pityoulish/tutorial/TutorialCommandHandler.java</span></div>
  <div class="input"
       ><span>jar -cfe tutorial.jar pityoulish.tutorial.Main pityoulish/</span></div>
</div>

<p>
The first command calls the Java compiler, <code>javac</code>. The argument is
the source file to compile. You can specify more than one, or use wildcards to
select all the source files you modify. Without other arguments, the compiler
puts the compiled .class files into the same directory as the source files.
The second command, <code>jar</code>, creates ('c') a new
JAR file ('f') named 'tutorial.jar' and
sets the entry point ('e') to class <code>pityoulish.tutorial.Main</code>.
The JAR file contains everything from directory 'pityoulish',
including all subdirectories.
</p>


<!-- ............................................................ -->
<div class="side-note"><div class="content">
<span>Test the Fix</span>
</div></div>

<p>
Finally, you're ready to test the <code>islocal</code> command with your
changes. Try it with some IP addresses and hostnames that are printed by the
<code>local</code> command. These should be recognized as local addresses.
Try some other hostnames, such as 'example.com'. These should be recognized
as non-local addresses.
If either one is not the case, your code is buggy. Go back and fix it,
compile, create a new JAR, and test again; until it works as expected.
</p>

<p>
When the command is working as expected, play around some more. Can you
find local hostnames that are not printed by the <code>local</code> command?
For example, try your computer's name without a domain, or with
domain '.local'. What about other IP addresses, like '127.0.0.8'?
It's OK to play for a while, you've earned it!
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="fix-lookup"><span>Fix the <code>lookup</code> Command</span></h3>

<p>
Call the <code>lookup</code> command of your JAR.
Interpret the stack trace and locate where the code is missing.
Take in the surroundings. What input data do you have?
What should the missing code do?
There are descriptions and hints in the source code.
What data will you need?
</p>

<p>
The comments point to a helper method you can use.
Read the description of the helper.
What arguments does it expect? What output does it provide?
Don't bother with its implementation now, stay focused on the problem.
Search for places where the helper is already used,
to see how it is done there.
</p>

<p>
The helper expects objects of class <code>InetAddress</code>.
From what package is that class? Browse its JavaDocs.
Any hints on how to obtain such objects?
From a hostname, which is the only input you have?
There are different methods you could call, which is the right one?
If you're not sure, go back to where the code is missing,
read the description and comments again.
</p>

<p>
OK, you've got all the pieces of the puzzle now. It is time to write code.
Remove calls to class <code>Missing</code>.
Put in code that looks up the internet addresses for the hostname.
Implement a loop that prints them, using the helper method.

Is there a problem when compiling?
Handle the exception that might be thrown by the lookup.
The user should know when that fails.
</p>

<p>
Create a JAR and test your brand new implementation of <code>lookup</code>.
Below are some hostnames to try.
Most of them require an internet connection for the lookup.
</p>

<ul>
<li>localhost &nbsp;-&nbsp;
  a subset of the output from the <code>local</code> command</li>

<li>nowhere.invalid &nbsp;-&nbsp; no address at all</li>

<!-- lookups performed on 2015-12-17: -->

<li>gnu.org &nbsp;-&nbsp; a single IPv4 address</li>

<li>apache.org &nbsp;-&nbsp; two different IPv4 addresses</li>

<li>fsf.org &nbsp;-&nbsp; both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address</li>
</ul>

<p>
Perform some more lookups of your own.
If everything works, go back to your code once more.
Read it again. Then clean it up.
Is the code properly formatted?
Are there leftover comments from before, which no longer make sense?
Will somebody else understand what you've written,
or do you have to add comments of your own?
In the latter case, consider rewriting your code
so that it can be understood without comments.
</p>

<p>
Congratulations, you fixed the <code>lookup</code> command all by yourself.
Good job!
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="clean-up"><span>Clean Up</span></h3>

<p>
The class <code>Missing</code> is just an artifice to mark the places
where you have to insert code. That's why it does not appear in the
generated <a href="jdoc/index.html">JavaDocs</a> for this tutorial.
Now that you have fixed both of the broken commands,
<code>Missing</code> is no longer needed.
</p>

<p>
Delete both the source file and the compiled class from your project.
If you are using an editor rather than an IDE, delete the directory
'pityoulish/outtake/' and everything within. Then re-compile the classes
in package <code>pityoulish.tutorial</code> and create a new JAR.
There might be an unused import statement that you have to remove.
</p>

<p>
Splendid! You have successfully completed this tutorial.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h1 id="recipe"><span>Recipe</span></h1>

<p>
The Java classroom exercises adhere to a common pattern. The following recipe
for solving them comprises the development procedures established above.
After completing this tutorial, you are well prepared for the classroom.
</p>


<!-- ............................................................ -->
<div class="side-note"><div class="content">
<span>Understand &amp; Plan</span>
</div></div>

<p>
Read the exercise description.
Download the JAR and read the usage instructions.
There is a set of commands with a common topic.
Unlike in the tutorial, those commands are not independent.
Some of them require the output of an other as input.
Prepare a sequence in which you can execute the commands.
Think of it as a user session, a typical scenario for using the JAR.
If necessary, prepare different sequences for different groups of commands.
The exercise description might help you with that.
</p>

<p>
Study the JavaDocs provided with the exercise.
Can you spot the classes which implement the commands?
Which packages and classes contain the 'real' functionality?
Which contain only utility stuff and supporting functions?
Don't dive into the source code yet, just get an overview.
</p>

<p>
Give the JAR a decent name.
Create a project in your IDE or simply extract the JAR.
</p>

<!-- ............................................................ -->
<div class="side-note"><div class="content">
<span>Test &amp; Fix</span>
</div></div>

<p>
Execute your command sequence until you encounter a <code>Missing</code>
exception. Interpret the stack trace and find where the code is missing.
Take in the surroundings. What should the missing code do?
Should it print something, initialize attributes, perform IO?
What input data do you have available, from arguments or stored in attributes?
</p>

<p>
What APIs can you use to solve the problem?
What APIs are already in use? Read their JavaDocs.
Does the standard Java API provide what you need?
Are there helpers in the code of the programming exercise?
Are there other commands that do something similar?
Can you re-use ideas or code snippets from those?
</p>

<p>
Insert the missing code. Compile it and create a new JAR.
Test the changes. Does the command now work as expected?
Consider error cases, too.
If the command works, clean up your code before you move on.
The instructor might come around and ask to see it.
</p>

<p>
Continue with the command sequence until you can execute it
all the way through. When you're done with all the command sequences,
delete class <code>Missing</code>.
This is the ultimate check that you didn't overlook something.

  In the classroom exercises, you'll be facing a server which
  implements the <a href="message-board.html">Message Board</a>.
  Now is a good time to read the description.
  It will save you time during the first classroom exercise.
