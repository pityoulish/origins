Objective of this exercise...

<div class="larger">
<span class="todo">Overview...</span>

it's about the  <a href="message-board.html">Message Board</a>
and Java Sockets.
With a <a href="protocol-tlv.html">Binary Protocol</a>.

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="upfront"><span>What You Need</span></h2><!-- Ingredients -->

<div class="box-right">
<dl>
<dt><a href="mbserver-sockets.jar"
       ><code>mbserver-sockets.jar</code></a></dt>
<dd>The server program. Usage instructions:
  <br/><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;java -jar mbserver-sockets.jar X</code><br/>
</dd>
</dl>
</div><!-- box-right -->

<ul class="todo">
<li>
Tutorial. Give as homework, one or two weeks of headroom.
<i>Details to be fleshed out.</i>
</li>
<li>
Server. Any Netbook with a recent JDK will do.
Video output (HDMI, VGA?) to connect to projector or other shared display.
</li>
<li>
Network. Wireless access point without Internet connection will do.
Might even be better than having an Internet connection:
less distraction, no access to Pityoulish sources.
</li>
<li>
Software. Local web server with exercise and Java API docs;
optional if Internet connection is available.
Message Board socket server, see box.
</li>
<li>
Client. Different machine!
<i>Only for the rehearsal, but you MUST rehearse.</i>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Tech Rehearsal.
</p>

<ul class="todo">
<li>
Connect server to network. Look up IP address or hostname.
</li>
<li>
Start web server.
Connect client to network.
Access web server from client: Exercise, Java API docs.
Use IP address or hostname in URL? http or https?
</li>
<li>
Start Message Board Socket server in terminal.
Fixed port or random port?
Access Message Board server from other machine.
Use IP address or hostname? Firewall in the way?
</li>
<li>
Connect server to projector or other shared display.
Do you get a picture?
Need to adjust graphic adapter settings?
Mirror display or extend desktop?
</li>
<li>
Move terminal to shared display.
Adjust window size, 80 columns or more recommended.
Output readable from the back row?
Adjust font size and colors.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Content Rehearsal.
</p>

<ul class="todo">
<li>
Work through the Tutorial yourself, if you haven't done so yet.
</li>
<li>
Work through the Exercise yourself.
</li>
<li>
You need to be prepared even better than the students, so you can help them.
</li>
</ul>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="schedule"><span>Schedule</span></h3>

<ul class="todo">
<li>
How much time for programming in-class? 60 minutes, 45 minutes?
</li>
<li>
How much time for discussions afterwards?
Make sure you have room to spare if things go wrong.
Make sure you have other material prepared, if things go smoothly.
</li>
<li>
How to form groups of 2 to 3 students? Neighbors, random, other?
How much time to form groups?
</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>How to List Messages with different markers</dt>
<dd>
<p>
You get a marker in response to a List Messages operation.
The marker indicates where in the message stream the returned messages end.
List messages with different limits to fetch less than the available messages.
</p>
<!-- <br/>-->
<p>
Alternatively, put more messages on the board and list messages again.
The markers from previous responses remain valid.
</p>
</dd>

<h3 id="answers"><span>Answers</span></h3>

<p>
The exercise mentions gaps in the suggested test sequence.
The known gaps in the good cases are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Empty batch in response to List Messages</dt>
<dd>
This case is likely to be encountered when testing with markers,
but not enforced by the test sequence.
It cannot be encountered without marker, because the board is never empty.
The server always puts an initial message on the board.
</dd>

<dt>Missed messages indicator in response to List Messages</dt>
<dd>
<p>
To get an indicator for missed messages, messages must drop off the board
while the students are testing with markers. If the board capacity is high
and the message volume low, that is unlikely to happen.
</p>
<p>
Students can force this situation by getting a marker from the beginning
of the board and then putting more messages on the board until at least
two user messages are dropped.
Depending on the board capacity, that may be a tedious task.
The instructor can help by choosing a low capacity.

<h2 id="learned"><span>Lessons Learned</span></h2>

<!-- How much of this here, how much in Exercise? -->
<ul class="todo">
<li>
Did the students get through the full test sequence within the allotted time?
Did they find and fix all the problems?
</li>
<li>
If not, why?
Bad preparation on the students' side, or on the instructor's?
Not enough time allotted? Lack of skills?
Shortcomings of the exercise itself?
</li>
<li>
Spotted things not covered by the test sequence?
</li>
<li>
Gather feedback from the students.
What (unplanned) problems did they encounter?
What did they learn?
How did they like the exercise?
Suggested improvements?
</li>
</ul>
