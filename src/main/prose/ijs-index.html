  <span>Instructor's Notes: Message Board with Sockets</span>
</h1>
<p class="abstract">
During this exercise, students will get a glimpse of how tedious it is
to implement a low-level protocol on top of socket connections or other
primitive communication mechanisms.
</p>

<div class="larger">
<p>
You're going to run a <a href="message-board.html">Message Board</a> server
which implements the <a href="protocol-tlv.html">Binary Protocol</a>.
Students have to fix a Java client that connects to your server via sockets.
Missing code requires the students
to open connections, create requests, and parse responses.
The server generates console output
to provide immediate feedback about incoming requests.
</p>

<p>
Students must work through the <b>Tutorial</b> to prepare for Java exercises.
Assign it as homework at least one week before the classroom exercise.
Maybe two weeks, depending on the proficiency and workload of the students.
Refer to section <a href="classroom-setup.html#schedule">Schedule</a>
in the <a href="classroom-setup.html">Classroom Setup</a>
for planning the classroom session.
</p>
<p>
Explain protocol families (IPv4/v6), host addresses, and port numbers
before the Tutorial.
Explain socket connections before the classroom exercise.
Explain TLVs before the classroom exercise, maybe on the very day.
That's an opportunity to discuss protocol design,
before or after the exercise.

Advantages and drawbacks of bit-level protocols
like <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2795#section-3"
    class="covert">IMPS</a>,
compared to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690"
    title="Overview of X.690 on Wikipedia" class="covert">TLVs</a>,
or text-based protocols like
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616" class="covert">HTTP/1.1</a>?

Why not use plain
<a href="http://www.json.org/" class="covert">JSON</a> or
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322" class="covert">IMF</a>
in the transport layer?
<!--
The transport layer has no (simple) way to detect the end of a message.
Would have to close the connection to indicate the end,
or define a message terminator that is invalid JSON/IMF (null byte?),
or parse JSON in the transport layer.
Parsing JSON should better be left to a higher layer.

</p>


<p>
Refer to section <a href="classroom-setup.html#procure">What You Need</a>
in the <a href="classroom-setup.html">Classroom Setup</a>
for generic hardware and software requirements.

The expected <b>server runtime</b> is a Java Development Kit (JDK).
A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) might suffice,
but it's better to be prepared for compiling something.
<a href="mbserver-sockets.jar"
       ><code>mbserver-sockets.jar</code></a>
contains the Message Board server with sockets,
see the box above for usage instructions.

Recommended information to put on the local web server includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Classroom Exercise</li>
<li>Tutorial</li>
<li>Java API Docs</li>
</ul>

</div></div>

<p>
Perform the <a href="classroom-setup.html#rehearse">Tech Rehearsal</a>
as described in the <a href="classroom-setup.html">Classroom Setup</a>.
This will sort out power, display, network, and software configuration.
You don't want to discover in front of the students that your new computer
has a display adapter which doesn't connect to the projector,
that a cable is too short, or that an operating system update
has moved some configuration dialogs to arcane locations.
</p>

<p>
See above for the Message Board server program you need to run.
Parameters to consider:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Port number.
Pick one that isn't blocked by a firewall.
Does 2888 work?
</li>
<li>Board Capacity.
A low capacity, for example 8 instead of 800,
increases the probability of losing messages.
In a production system, that would be undesired.
During the exercise, it exposes a feature of the protocol.
</li>
<li>Server locale.
<i>As of 2016, the server is not yet localized to languages
  other than English.</i>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="side-note"><div class="content">
<span>Content</span>
</div></div>

<p>
Perform a <b>Content Rehearsal</b> by working through the exercise yourself,
on a dedicated client machine. That point is important. Some problems simply
won't arise as long as you are running client and server on the same machine.
If possible, use the actual network of your classroom setup, too.
</p>

<p>
If you're encountering problems during the Content Rehearsal,
maybe you should work through the Tutorial as well?
You need to be prepared even better than the students, because they will be
<span title="If they don't, your position as an instructor is doubtful."
      >looking to you for help</span>.
</p>


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h2 id="execute"><span>Execute</span></h2>

<p>
Setup the classroom exercise as in the Tech Rehearsal,
and follow your prepared schedule.
Form groups of two to three students working together.
Keep an eye on the server output,
so that the student messages don't get too silly.
You might want to put up a few messages of your own,
using the client that you fixed during the Content Rehearsal.
Or if you skipped the Content Rehearsal after all,
build a working client from the sources on GitHub.
</p>

<h3 id="hints"><span>Hints</span></h3>

<dl>
<dt>How to request another ticket</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Initially, the code for parsing a requested ticket is missing.
When repeating the command, the server responds with an error
because the client machine already has a ticket.
If the stack trace from the first attempt was scrolled off,
students can no longer pinpoint the problem.
</p>
<!-- <br/>-->
<p>
Read the ticket off the server screen to return it.
Or fix another problem and return to this one a few minutes later,
when the ticket has expired.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>How to List Messages with different markers</dt>
<dd>
<p>
You get a marker in response to a List Messages operation.
The marker indicates where in the message stream the returned messages end.
List messages with different limits to fetch less than the available messages.
</p>
<!-- <br/>-->
<p>
Alternatively, put more messages on the board and list messages again.
The markers from previous responses remain valid.
</p>
</dd>

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
<h3 id="answers"><span>Answers</span></h3>

<p>
The exercise mentions gaps in the suggested test sequence.
The known gaps in the good cases are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Empty batch in response to List Messages</dt>
<dd>
This case is likely to be encountered when testing with markers,
but not enforced by the test sequence.
It cannot be encountered without marker, because the board is never empty.
The server always puts an initial message on the board.
</dd>

<dt>Missed messages indicator in response to List Messages</dt>
<dd>
<p>
To get an indicator for missed messages, messages must drop off the board
while the students are testing with markers. If the board capacity is high
and the message volume low, that is unlikely to happen.
</p>
<p>
Students can force this situation by getting a marker from the beginning
of the board and then putting more messages on the board until at least
two user messages are dropped.
Depending on the board capacity, that may be a tedious task.
The instructor can help by choosing a low capacity.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="review"><span>Review</span></h2>

<dl>
<dt>Feedback</dt>

Gather feedback from the students.
Do they feel that the exercise was useful?
What did they learn from it?
Suggestions for improvements?
</dd>

<dt>Time</dt>
<dd>
How many of the groups completed the full test sequence?
Should you have allotted more time?

Did they spot the things not covered by the test sequence?
Maybe even things not listed above?
</dd>

<dt>Skill</dt>
<dd>
What unplanned problems did the students encounter, and why?
Bad preparation, because they didn't work through the Tutorial?
Or was something important missing from the Tutorial,
in the Exercise description, or
in the topics you taught before the exercise?
</dd>

<dt>Objective</dt>
<dd>
Did the exercise serve your intended purpose,
did it transport what you wanted to teach?
