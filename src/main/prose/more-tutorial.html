List the contents of the JAR file.

or any other archive utility that is compatible with the zip format.
The example output below shows only a subset of the files.

On first glance, it seems as if classes are listed twice. Indeed,
a closer look reveals that the JAR contains source code (.java)
along with compiled classes (.class). The presence of 'package.html' files
suggests that there might even be meaningful JavaDocs.
It is always possible to generate JavaDocs from source code.
But if the source code doesn't contain special JavaDoc comments,
the generated docs are not necessarily useful. Alas, the mere presence of
JavaDoc comments also doesn't ensure that they contain anything useful.
Fortunately, this is a tutorial with well-documented source code.

<h2 id="jar-trouble"><span>Troubleshooting your JAR</span></h2>

<p>
This section explains some problems you might run into
when building your own JAR.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>JAR is not executable</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The JAR file contains Java classes, properties files, and a manifest.
The JAR is executable when its manifest specifies an entry point,
which is a classname.
If you are using an IDE, configure class <code>pityoulish.tutorial.Main</code>
as the entry point in the manifest.
If you are using a command line, the entry point is specified
with option '<code>e</code>' of the <code>jar</code> command.
</p>
<p>
When you create a project from a JAR file, your IDE should
read the entry point from the manifest.
But if you create a project from source code in the file system,
your IDE generates a new manifest without an entry point.
</p>
<p>
Instead of creating an executable JAR, you can also specify the classname
when starting the program.
The JAR then has to be put on the classpath with <code>-cp</code>
rather than being executed with <code>-jar</code>:
</p>
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="input"
       ><span>java -cp tutorial.jar pityoulish.tutorial.Main</span></div>
</div>
</dd>

<dt>Output contains <code>CatalogData</code> instead of expected text</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Human-readable text for output is stored in properties files.
These properties files can be translated into different languages
without changing the source code and compiling new classes.
The properties files are part of the source code and
must be available at runtime.
If they are missing, the program will print lookup keys
instead of the texts it cannot look up.
</p>
<p>
If you are running a JAR file, bundle the properties files into the JAR.
<br/>
If you are running the program directly from an IDE project,
add the source directory to the classpath.
</p>
</dd>

<h2 id="jdoc-walk-through"><span>JavaDoc Walk-Through</span></h3>

<p>
Before you dive into the source code and get lost in its intricacies,
you should get a high-level overview. Modern IDEs make it very easy to
access context-specific information. For example, they can show the JavaDocs
for a method as hover help, right there where the method is being called.
At the same time, they beguile developers into neglecting the bigger context.
Why bother with the class- or package-level JavaDocs, when the method-level
is readily available? Never mind that the former might point out
other classes or methods that would serve your purposes better, or
provide valuable information that applies to all the methods of a class.
To elude this pitfall, don't go into your IDE or editor just yet.
</p>

<p>
Open the <a href="jdoc/index.html" target="_blank">JavaDocs</a>
in a new browser tab or window,
so you can easily switch between them and this description.
Check the list of packages. There are three of them,
<code>pityoulish.cmdline</code>, <code>pityoulish.i18n</code>,
and <code>pityoulish.tutorial</code>.
In the main content frame, click on the first one. Now you see a list of
interfaces and classes in that package. Glimpse at the names. They are
about commands, handling, and arguments. The package description begins
with "Utility classes". This indicates that the package does not contain
the main functionality of the program, but supporting features.
Are you interested in learning how the command-line arguments are interpreted?
If so, write it down on your to-do list for later.
Right now, the support functionality is not your concern.
</p>

<p>
Move on to the next package, <code>pityoulish.i18n</code>.
The funny abbreviation is explained in the JavaDocs. There are even links
to external websites where you can do some background reading.
But again, the package description begins with "Utility classes".
So this is another item for your to-do list and a later time.
What you should gather from the package description is that
output strings are not hard-coded in the Java sources.
Instead, they are looked up from properties files.
Catalog enums define lookup keys and helper methods.
</p>

<p>
Finally, access the JavaDocs for the <code>pityoulish.tutorial</code> package.
There is a class <code>Main</code>, described as the main entry point.
Now you know where to start. There is an enum with four constants,
named like the four commands which <code>tutorial.jar</code> understands.
And there is a handler class with methods named like the four commands.
Could <code>handleLatinCmd</code> be the method which prints the umlauts
for the 'latin' command? Yes, the description says so.
Without even looking at the source code, you've learned where the
important things are happening.
</p>

<h2 id="source-walk-through"><span>Source Code Walk-Through</span></h3>

<p>
Now it is time to browse the source code. If you didn't know already
from the JavaDocs where to start, you would have to look into the file
<code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code>. It defines a property 'Main-Class',
which tells <code>java -jar</code> about the entry point of the program.
Unsurprisingly, the value is <code>pityoulish.tutorial.Main</code>.
Open the source file for that class in your IDE or editor.
</p>

<p>
The <code>main</code> method initializes an arg(ument)s interpreter,
calls it with the command-line arguments, and is done.
If you hadn't looked at the JavaDocs first, you would now probably
follow the program execution and look into the args interpreter.
However, you already know that it comes from a utility package, and that
the commands are implemented in <code>TutorialCommandHandler</code>.
An instance of that class is given to the args interpreter as a
constructor argument. The other constructor argument is some kind of 'None',
so probably not relevant here. The natural conclusion is that
the args interpreter will call the command handler.
Let's go directly to the latter, without wasting time on the former.
</p>

<p>
Looking at <code>TutorialCommandHandler</code>, you see the enumeration of
supported commands, a method that returns usage instructions, and a method
with a <code>switch</code> statement on the enum. Each case of that statement
calls a handler method for the respective command.
Whatever else the args interpreter does, it calls here to execute a command.
That's all you need to know about it to get started.
